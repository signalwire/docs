    description: >
      Multi-factor authentication, commonly known as MFA, adds security to your
      application by requesting a user to be verified via voice or via text
      message.


      It can also be used for One Time Password flows (OTP).


      SignalWire will place a voice call or send a message to the destination
      you specify, and create an unique code for them. When your application
      receives input from the user, it will use the verification endpoint to
      check that the ID for the request and the token match. The API keeps track
      of attempts.
  - name: Verified Caller IDs
    description: >
      This is an object that represents a phone number that is not purchased
      through SignalWire. In order place a call from a phone number not
      purchased through SignalWire, you must first verify that you are the owner
      of that number. For more information on Verified Caller IDs you can [read
      about
      them](https://signalwire.com/blogs/product/verified-caller-id-local-number-portability).


      ### How This Works

      In order to use a number that you have not purchased through SignalWire as
      a Caller ID, value you must first verify that you own that number. You are
      limited to 10 calls to a given number with a one week period.

       1. Create a Verified Caller ID Object using the appropriate REST endpoint.
       2. The SignalWire platform will place a call to the phone number that you specified.
         * You may request a redial by submitting a request to the Redial Verification Call Endpoint.
       3. When the phone is answered, we will read a six-digit code.
       4. To verify that you are the owner, take that number and submit it to the Validate Verifications Endpoint.
         * You have 5 attempts to enter the code correctly.
