Version 3.8 of the RELAY Realtime SDK is out now and introduces a new feature for Video: Interactive Live Streaming.
Here are the highlights.

## Interactive Live Streaming

Interactive Live Streaming is a Video product that provides a flexible middle ground between RTMP
streaming and a Video conference. RTMP streaming allows a user to stream their audio and video to a passive audience,
while a video conference allows all users to transmit and receive audio and video.
Interactive Live Streaming allows users to experience either state or switch between them in one Video room depending on their role.

## Join a Video Room as a `member` or `audience`
To join a Video Room with `member` abilities to send and receive audio and video or `audience` permissions
to only receive audio and video, you must generate a Room Token with the appropriate parameters.

### From a Node server
```js
try {
  let token = await axios.post(
    apiurl + "/room_tokens",
    {
      user_name: user_name,
      room_name: room_name,
      join_as: "audience",
    },
    { auth }
  );
  console.log(token.data.token);

  return res.json({ token: token.data.token });
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
  return res.sendStatus(500);
}
```

### With cURL

```shell
curl -L -X POST "https://$SPACE_URL/api/video/room_tokens" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -u "$PROJECT_ID:$API_TOKEN" \
  --data-raw '{
    "room_name": "my_room",
    "user_name": "John Smith",
    "join_as": "audience"
  }'
```

## Promote Audience or Demote Members
To change the interactivity mode of a participant, the methods `promote()` and `demote()`
have been added to the `RoomSession` object. [bc56cc4](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/bc56cc42497220d43085adea8f3834fbce60444b)

`promote` requires the audience participant's ID, and you may choose to set specific Video Room permissions.

```js
await roomSession.promote({
  memberId: "de550c0c-3fac-4efd-b06f-b5b8614b8966",
  mediaAllowed: "all",
  permissions: [
    "room.self.audio_mute",
    "room.self.audio_unmute",
    "room.self.video_mute",
    "room.self.video_unmute",
    "room.list_available_layouts",
  ],
});
```

Optional parameters on `promote` include `meta`, `joinAudioMuted` and `joinVideoMuted`.
[bc56cc4](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/bc56cc42497220d43085adea8f3834fbce60444b)

See the [`promote` technical reference](https://developer.signalwire.com/sdks/relay-realtime-sdk/video/video-roomsession#promote)
for a full list of parameters.

`demote` removes the participant's ability to send audio and video.
[Technical reference](https://developer.signalwire.com/sdks/relay-realtime-sdk/video/video-roomsession#demote)

```js
await roomSession.demote({
  memberId: "de550c0c-3fac-4efd-b06f-b5b8614b8966",
  mediaAllowed: "all",
});
```

## Audience Count Event
The `room.audience_count` event is available on the `RoomSession` object to track the audience count.
It is triggered periodically as audience participants join and leave the room session.
