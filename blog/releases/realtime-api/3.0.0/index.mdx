This release marks the beginning of the RELAY Realtime SDK with the integration of Voice and Messaging RELAY with our existing Realtime SDK for Video and Chat.

## Highlights

### Voice
You can now instantiate a Voice Client, subscribe to events, and make and answer calls. For example:

```js
import { Voice } from '@signalwire/realtime-api';

const client = new Voice.Client({
  project: '<project-id>',
  token: '<project-token>',
  contexts: '<context>'
});

client.on('call.received', async (call) => {
  console.log('Got call', call.id, call.from, call.to, call.direction);
});

try {
  const call = await client.dialPhone({
      to: 'to number',
      from: 'from number',
      timeout: 30,
  })
  console.log('Dial resolved!', call.id)
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Connect Error', error)
};
```
With `Voice`, you can also
- record audio
- play audio
-  listen for digits or speech using `prompt()`

### Messaging
You can use the same structure to instantiate a Messaging Client, subscribe to events, and send and receive messages.

```js
import { Messaging } from '@signalwire/realtime-api';

const client = new Messaging.Client({
  project: '<project-id>',
  token: '<project-token>',
  contexts: '<context>'
});

client.on('message.received', (message) => {
  console.log('message.received', message)
})

try {
  const response = await client.send({
    from: '+1xxx',
    to: '+1yyy',
    body: 'Hello World!',
  })
  console.log('>> send response', response)
} catch (error) {
  console.log('>> send error', error)
}

```

## Fixes

 - Fix: expose all the active recordings on the `room.joined` event (#501) 5c96bf8

## Improvements
- We have introduced the PubSub namespace to keep the minimal PubSub functionality available to users as Chat continues to develop (#533) b6d5bb3
