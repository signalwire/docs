Version 3.6.0 of the Realtime SDK is a small release and includes some improvements and a fix.

## Improvements
- We have added an `inputSensitivity` type for Call recording methods to improve the recording experience with background noise. [583ef73](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/583ef730675884b51045784980a12d80fc573b3b)
- We have added the `ended()` method in Voice to replace both `waitForEnded` and `waitForResult`. [3e7ce64](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/3e7ce6461a423e5b1014f16bf69b53793dfe1024)
- The new alias `detectAnsweringMachine(params)` has been added to the `amd(params)` method on `Voice.Call` for better clarity. [a32413d](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/a32413d89f9dc155be91aa148c4c56edec7e8413)

## Fixes
- Fixed `disconnected` method on Voice Call to better handle listening for ended calls. [45248ff](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/45248ff253894b7b208d39f17cd24b68e1f1f0b5)

## Deprecations
- We are deprecating the methods `waitForEnded` and `waitForResult` in the Voice namespace. Please use `ended()` instead.
