This small release of version 3.10 of the Realtime SDK introduces a new method for Voice calls and fixes a Voice bug.

## Improvements

We have added the `call.pass()` method to pass an incoming call to another RELAY consumer. [`6a35f0a3`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/6a35f0a38071160a82f766bd8b73b4718f04108f)

This will allow a consumer to decline incoming calls without ending the call and redirect the call to another RELAY client.

```js
client.on("call.received", async (call) => {
  await call.pass();
});
```

# Fixes

- Fixed an undefined `setPayload` method on the CallTap instance. [`a7426731`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/a7426731f683b7a631fe0bc591b208fd2c21b5c0)
