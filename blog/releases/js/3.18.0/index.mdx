Version 3.18 of the JS SDK is a minor maintenance release with one improvement laying the groundwork for future features.

## Improvements

- We now allow a WebRTC connection to reconnect after a network change so that, for example, a video call can continue uninterrupted despite a network blip or page refresh. [4148281](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/414828131a81f5bf2e57d786d8002d96e25f7597)
- To support this improvement, we exposed new events on `RoomSession` to detect the media state: `media.connected`, `media.disconnected` and `media.reconnecting`. [4148281](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/414828131a81f5bf2e57d786d8002d96e25f7597)
