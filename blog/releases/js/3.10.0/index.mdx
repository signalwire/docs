Version 3.10 of the JavaScript SDK is out! Here are the main highlights.

## Highlights

### Positions

We have introduced the concept of *positions*. Every video layout now has a set of predetermined positions (e.g. _reserved-1_, _standard-1_, _off-cavas_), to which you can assign members. For example:

```js
await roomSession.setMemberPosition({
  memberId: "1bf4d4fb-a3e4-4d46-80a8-3ebfdceb2a60",
  position: "off-canvas"
})
```

Other methods have been updated to support positions. For example, to share the screen while changing layout:
```js
await roomSession.startScreenShare({
  audio: true,
  video: true,
  layout: "screen-share",
  positions: {
    "self": "reserved-1"
  }
})
```
