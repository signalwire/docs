This is a minor release of the SignalWire JavaScript SDK.

## Highlights
### Allow a speaker to be set when creating a room object
You can now select which speaker (or, generically, output device) to use as soon as you connect to the room. You can do this by specifying the `speakerId` key in the parameters of `SignalWire.Video.createRoomObject` or `SignalWire.Video.joinRoom`. For example:
```typescript
  const roomObj = await Video.joinRoom({
    token: '<YourJWT>',
    rootElementId: 'root',
    speakerId: '... your speaker id ...'
  })
```

### Introduced functions for checking the media methods supported in the current environment
We provide two new functions, [`supportsGetUserMedia`](https://developer.signalwire.com/client-sdk/reference/webrtc#supportsgetusermedia) and [`supportsGetDisplayMedia`](https://developer.signalwire.com/client-sdk/reference/webrtc#supportsgetdisplaymedia), that you can use to check whether the corresponding media methods are available in the current environment.

### Better audio by default in screen sharings
When you create a screen sharing object via `createScreenShareObject`, if you specify `{audio: true}` we will create for you an audio constraints object that will ensure superior audio quality.

## New Features

- Allow `speakerId` to be set when creating a room object to set the audio output device before join.

- Exports methods to check if the environment supports `getUserMedia` or `getDisplayMedia`

## Improved

- Apply `audio` and `video` constraints sent from the backend consuming the `mediaParams` event.

- Set parent memberId for screenShare and additionalDevice sessions. Add default `audio` constraints for screenShareObjects.
