## Added

- Support for `lock` and `unlock` on `RoomSessions`. This will allow the locking of the `RoomSession` which will prevent new members from being able to join. Additionally, room previews are stopped and replaced with a locked image. The `RoomSession` can be unlocked through the `unlock` method.


```js
const roomSession = new SignalWire.Video.RoomSession({
  token: "<YourRoomToken>",
  rootElement: document.getElementById("myVideoElement"),
});

// Short example that locks the room when a member joins and unlocks it when they leave.
roomSession.on("member.joined", (e) => {
  roomSession.lock();
});

roomSession.on("member.leave", (e) => {
  roomSession.unlock();
});
```

# Fixed

- Removed Video prefix from `member.updated` events to emit them properly.

# Updated

- @singalwire/webrtc dependency
- @signalwire/core dependecy
