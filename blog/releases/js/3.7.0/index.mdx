This release focuses on the _room previews_ feature, which allows you to access a link to a temporary video stream displaying a preview of what is going on in a room.

## Highlights

### Room Previews

We now support displaying a video preview of a room to the users *before* joining the room. For this to work you need to specify a `enable_room_previews: true` flag when creating a room (either from your Signalwire Space, from the REST APIs, or from a Token).

For example, let's say we want to [create a new room using the REST APIs](https://developer.signalwire.com/apis/reference/create_room). To enable room previews, you can add the `enable_room_previews` flag:

```shell
curl --request POST \
    --url https://yourspace.signalwire.com/api/video/rooms \
    --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Basic <your auth info here>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '
        {
            "name": "my_new_room",
            "display_name": "My New Room",
            "enable_room_previews": true
        }
    '
```

Then, from the JavaScript SDK you can obtain the URL of the recording after joining a room by calling

```js
roomSession.previewUrl
// Returns a URL such as 'https://files.signalwire.com/.../video-room-previews/..3251e299741a.mp4'
```

(note that it may take a few seconds for the URL to be ready)

Or, to obtain it *before* joining a room, simply use the REST APIs to [list room sessions](https://developer.signalwire.com/apis/reference/list_room_sessions): you'll find the URL in there too.

You can then download the video and use it however you need to. The video will be refreshed periodically: make sure to download it again when you want to display updated previews.
