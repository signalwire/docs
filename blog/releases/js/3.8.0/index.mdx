This release of the JavaScript SDK marks the introduction of Chat APIs. We have also made some additional improvements to our Video APIs to make it easier to use.

## Highlights

### Chat

You can now use our JavaScript SDK to create chat applications, or to add chat functionalities to your existing video applications. To get started, include the SDK as usual, for example from unpkg:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@signalwire/js@3"></script>
```

You will now be able to access the `SignalWire.Chat` namespace. Joining a chat is similar to how you join Room Sessions:

```js
const chatClient = new SignalWire.Chat.Client({
  token: token  // Get this from our REST APIs
});

// Subscribe to events
chatClient.on("message", message => { })

// Start receiving messages
await chatClient.subscribe(['channel1', 'channel2']);

// Publish a message
await chatClient.publish({
  channel: 'channel1',
  content: 'Hello!'
});
```

### List of members in a video room

We have introduced an additional event for RoomSession objects: `memberList.updated`. You will find this event handy if you're aiming to build a dynamically updated list of members in a room. You can use it like this:

```js
roomSession.on('memberList.updated', (e) => {
  // e.members contains the full list of members currently in the room.
  updateMyListOfMembers(e.members)
})
```

In this way, you don't need to manually keep track of `member.joined`, `member.updated`, and `member.left` events to keep your UI updated.
