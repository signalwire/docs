Version 3.16.0 is a minor release that contains a couple of fixes and improvements.

## Improvements

- We have enhanced the Video `roomSession.join()` signature with an optional argument to control the sending and receiving of media. [baf34a8](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/baf34a875965b7aed93ed4a7fc64767df46bb11a)

- The JavaScript SDK now exposes `.disconnect()` on PubSub and Chat clients. [8132100](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/8132100cb237dfe69136ef175c235690cfe577db)

## Deprecations

- Setting the `audio` and `video` properties in the RoomSession constructor has been deprecated. Specify them in the `join` method instead.

## Fixes

- We fixed the `updateCamera` and `updateMicrophone` logic to apply room changes to the localStream. [64e13ec](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/64e13ec60a812ba3dbab941ea3d2bfa5f27ad5fe)
