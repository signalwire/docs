We are happy to announce **JavaScript SDK 3.5.0**.

Upgrading is straightforward with our release process, which adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
Minor versions are guaranteed to not have breaking changes, so you can upgrade with confidence.

<ReleaseCard library="@signalwire/js" version="3.5.0" releaseType="minor"/>

This is a small maintenance release.

## Highlights

We have deprecated the methods `RoomSession.hideVideoMuted` and `RoomSession.showVideoMuted`. You should now prefer the use of `RoomSession.setHideVideoMuted`, which is consistent with our realtime-api package.

Before (now deprecated):
```javascript
await roomSession.hideVideoMuted()
await roomSession.showVideoMuted()
```

From now on:
```javascript
await roomSession.setHideVideoMuted(true)
await roomSession.setHideVideoMuted(false)
```

## Improvements

 - If you are joining an audio-only room session, you do not need to specify a `rootElement` anymore
 - You will now get documentation in your IDE for all SDK methods and objects

## Fixes

 - Fixed a possible race condition when applying the localVideo overlay
 - Fixed a possible race condition on RoomSession.join() method.
 - Fixed an issue with the connection not being able to be established when video/audio permissions were not granted.
