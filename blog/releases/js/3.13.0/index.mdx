Version 3.13 of the JavaScript SDK is out! We have added a couple of improvements. Here are the highlights.

## Highlights

### RoomSession event `room.left`

- We have added a new event  `room.left` which allows users to listen for when a RoomSession's creator leaves the RoomSession. 20f61a7d
For example:

```javascript
room.on("room.left", () => {
      console.log("You have left the room.")
});
```
### Video Playback

We have exposed methods to `seek` a specific video position during playback. d308daf8
These include:

- `playback.seek(timecode)` seeks the current playback time to the specified absolute position.
```javascript
const playback = await roomSession.play({ url: "rtmp://example.com/foo" });
await playback.seek(30_000); // 30th second
```

- `playback.forward(offset)` seeks the current playback time forward by the specified offset.
```javascript
const playback = await roomSession.play({ url: "rtmp://example.com/foo" });
await playback.forward(5000); // 5 seconds
```

- `playback.rewind(offset)` seeks the current playback time backward by the specified offset.
```javascript
const playback = await roomSession.play({ url: "rtmp://example.com/foo" });
await playback.rewind(5000); // 5 seconds
```

Note that the boolean property `seekable` has been added to `RoomSessionPlayback` to support these methods.
