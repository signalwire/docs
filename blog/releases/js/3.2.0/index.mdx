## Highlights

We are excited to announce the release of @signalwire/js v3.2.0.

With this new version of the JS SDK we have introduced the ability to **record your rooms**! As usual, this is a matter of a few lines of codes. For example:

```typescript
const rec = await room.startRecording()
await rec.stop()
await room.getRecordings()
/*
{
  "recordings": [
    {
      "id": "94ec917c-ff9c-4d57-9111-7d93a8f6e3e8",
      "state": "completed",
      "duration": 4.66,
      "started_at": 1630681129.936,
      "ended_at": 1630681133.7655
    }
  ]
}
*/
```

After a room has been recorded, you can download the mp4 file from SignalWire's servers to obtain your video recording. You can do that by using the [REST API](https://developer.signalwire.com/apis/reference/overview):

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://<yourspace>.signalwire.com/api/video/room_recordings/94ec917c-ff9c-4d57-9111-7d93a8f6e3e8 \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Basic <your API token>'
```

The above GET request will return a recording object with a `uri` field that you can follow to obtain the mp4 file.

## New Features

- Room objects now exposes the methods [startRecording](/sdks/reference/browser-sdk/video/video-roomsession#startrecording) and [getRecordings](/sdks/reference/browser-sdk/video/video-roomsession#getrecordings), which you can use for controlling recordings of the current room session.
- Room objects now emit [events associated with recordings](/sdks/reference/browser-sdk/video/video-roomsession#events). These are `recording.started`, `recording.updated`, and `recording.ended`.

## Improvements

- We have improved the TypeScript documentation for the WebRTC methods. Enjoy the rich method descriptions and examples from IntelliSense, without leaving your editor:

## Deprecations
- For consistency, we have renamed the old events `member.talking.start` and `member.talking.stop` into, respectively, `member.talking.started` and `member.talking.ended`. The old event names have been deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

## Fixes

- We have included minor bug fixes
