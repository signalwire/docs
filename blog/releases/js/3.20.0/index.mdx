Version 3.20 of the JavaScript SDK includes a small new feature for Video: local video stream mirroring.

## Mirroring the Local Video Stream
We have exposed the property `localOverlay` on a Video `RoomSession` object. The method `setMirrored` on this new property allows a user to mirror their local video overlay. [`2e58a76b`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/2e58a76b6b505ca1d7ed5f6711dd33039a7ed84f)

```javascript
await roomSession.localOverlay.setMirrored(true);
```

The mirrored local stream is sent to the SignalWire Multipoint Control Unit (MCU), muxed into a single unified stream, and visible to all participants.

You can also unset mirroring with

```javascript
await roomSession.localOverlay.setMirrored(false);
```
