The latest version of the JavaScript SDK is out. It has mostly fixes and a minor improvement.

## Improvements
- Added a `permissions` property on the Video `RoomSession` object to list the permissions available to the member. [c1b5025](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/c1b5025e508d2352e51287693afa2abab2ced4c0)

## Fixes

- Fixed `localVideo` overlay updates when leaving and rejoining the same Video room. [37ab859](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/37ab859d2883efcef34d7d594ad241ee0a9cbef4)
