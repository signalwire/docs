This is a maintenance release that contains several minor fixes and improvements.

## Notes

If you were relying on the DOM id of the internal video overlay element, please note that the id is now prefixed with the string `sw-sdk-` to avoid clashing with user-code ids. Since this is an undocumented internal detail, the vast majority of users will be unaffected. See https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/pull/370.

## Fixes
 - Hide the local video overlay element when the user's video is not in the layout 2b1e970
 - Add prefix to the DOM elements created by the SDK to make them unique. ba0647b
 - RoomSession: Improve TypeScript signature for member methods with optional properties  dd41abaa3ed3c5d93f7e546323fce51f9158ec23
 - Fix definition types f494e05a28e013d29431c93690d2382db8df96e8
 - Fix logic to handle the `redirectDestination` case where the SDK should resend the invite to a specific node. 499f62a7a02fe023a197aa950cbda975ef4509b0
