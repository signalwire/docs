We are excited to announce the latest version of our JavaScript SDK! This release mainly focuses on a number of improvements on the side of API usability.

## Highlights

### A new way to join rooms
To simplify our API we have introduced a new way to join rooms. The most important entry point for the API is now the `RoomSession` object, which is flexible enough to support all the use cases that were covered by the old `createRoomObject` and `joinRoom`. Take a look down below to know how to update your code.

## Deprecations

### setMicrophoneVolume and setSpeakerVolume have been deprecated

To make our API more consistent, we have renamed the methods `setMicrophoneVolume` and `setSpeakerVolume` to, respectively, `setInputVolume` and `setOutputVolume`. Please update your code to use the new names, as the deprecated methods will be removed in a future version of the SDK.

Before (deprecated):
```typescript
roomSession.setMicrophoneVolume({memberId: id, volume: -10});
roomSession.setSpeakerVolume({memberId: id, volume: -10});
member.setMicrophoneVolume({volume: -10});
member.setSpeakerVolume({volume: -10});
```

After:
```typescript
roomSession.setInputVolume({memberId: id, volume: -10});
roomSession.setOutputVolume({memberId: id, volume: -10});
member.setInputVolume({volume: -10});
member.setOutputVolume({volume: -10});
```

### createRoomObject and joinRoom have been deprecated
[#313](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/pull/313) [`5c35910`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/5c3591034abee66519ffa6593bb1a50144ec0d7c)

The functions `createRoomObject` and `joinRoom` have been deprecated. Their functionality has been replaced by the new `RoomSession` class. Please update your code to use the `RoomSession` class, as the deprecated methods will be removed in a future version of the SDK.

Before (deprecated):
```typescript
SignalWire.Video.createRoomObject({
  token: "...",
  rootElementId: "stream",
  video: true,
}).then(roomObject => {
  roomObject.on('room.started', (e) => { console.log(e) })
  roomObject.join()
}

// or:

SignalWire.Video.joinRoom({
  token: "...",
  rootElementId: "stream",
  video: true,
}).then(roomObject => {
  // here, handlers were attached *after* joining
  roomObject.on('room.started', (e) => { console.log(e) })
}
```

After:
```typescript
const roomSession = new SignalWire.Video.RoomSession({
  token: "...",
  rootElement: document.getElementById("stream"),  // NOTE: you should now pass an HTMLElement
  video: true,
})

roomSession.on('room.started', (e) => { console.log(e) })

roomSession.join()
```

### createScreenShareObject has been deprecated
[#318](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/pull/318) [`cc5fd62`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/cc5fd6227689855e6b4127c537f7ac77b3f75c7f)

We have deprecated the `createScreenShareObject` in favor of the new `startScreenShare`. The new method is fully compatible: you can update your code by replacing `roomSession.createScreenShareObject()` invocations with `roomSession.startScreenShare()`.

## Breaking changes

### Timestamp properties now are Date objects
[#305](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/pull/305) [`cec54bd`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/cec54bd208801f42a719a7777da802ae2c51a79a)

To make our API easier to use, we have converted the timestamp properties within the SDK to Date object. This breaking change only affects you if you are using the Recording features.

Assume `rec` is a `RoomSessionRecording` object of which you use the fields `startedAt` and `endedAt`. It may look like this:
```typescript
myFunction(rec.startedAt)
myFunction(rec.endedAt)
```

If you upgrade to this version of the SDK, make sure to convert them back to a number to make the rest of your code compatible:
```typescript
myFunction(+rec.startedAt)
myFunction(+rec.endedAt)
```

## Fixes

We have included some minor bug fixes.
