This release marks the **first stable version of the JavaScript SDK v3**!
With respect to the previous major release of the JavaScript SDK, version 3 allows you to manage an environment with multiple rooms and participants for building full-fledged video-conferencing applications and much more. Take a look at the [Getting Started](https://developer.signalwire.com/client-sdk/docs/getting-started) information on our developers website.

Please note that some of the features that were present in the old SDK are still missing, and will be included in the upcoming updates to version 3. For more information on the differences between the functionalities offered by the old and the new SDK, refer to our [Getting Started](https://developer.signalwire.com/client-sdk/docs/getting-started-1) guide.

If you have been an early user of version 3 by following our beta releases, **here's what changed since the latest preliminary release** (beta 6). For the complete changelog with respect to the previous major release, see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/blob/%40signalwire/js%403.0.0/packages/js/CHANGELOG.md).

## Highlights
### New helper methods to create device watchers
Previously, if you wanted to create a device watcher for a single device, you had to manually specify the device category, as in:
```typescript
h = await SignalWire.WebRTC.createDeviceWatcher({targets: ['microphone']})
```

You can still use `createDeviceWatcher` to listen to the events of one or more devices, but we have introduced the methods `createCameraDeviceWatcher`, `createMicrophoneDeviceWatcher` and `createSpeakerDeviceWatcher` which can help make your code cleaner. The previous example would become:
```typescript
h = await SignalWire.WebRTC.createMicrophoneDeviceWatcher()
```

### Fixed behavior of `setMicrophoneVolume()` and `setSpeakerVolume()`
If you were using our beta SDK, you may have run into a bug in which `setMicrophoneVolume()` actually controlled the volume of the speaker, and vice versa. We have fixed that, so you may need to update your code accordingly.

## New Features
- Export `createCameraDeviceWatcher`, `createMicrophoneDeviceWatcher` and `createSpeakerDeviceWatcher` helper methods

## Bug Fixes
- Update the filtering logic for the device list where Firefox could return a device with `deviceId` but with empty `label`.
- Fix `setMicrophoneVolume()` behavior on Room, RoomDevice and RoomScreenShare objects. Fix `setSpeakerVolume()` behavior on Room object.
