        This endpoint supports two different access methods with different authentication requirements:


        ## Public Access (No Authentication Required)

        
        Recording audio files can be accessed directly without authentication. This is useful for external applications

        to embed recording URLs without exposing SignalWire API credentials. SignalWire recording URLs are long 

        and random, making them difficult to guess or exploit unless you reveal the URL.


        **Retrieve WAV file**


        When a recording URI has no extension or a `.wav` extension, the request

        will return a binary WAV version of the recording file.


        `GET
        https://example.signalwire.com/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Recordings/{Sid}`


        `GET
        https://example.signalwire.com/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Recordings/{Sid}.wav`


        **Retrieve MP3 file**


        Setting an extension of ".mp3" on the URI returns a binary MP3 version

        of the recording. For example:


        `GET
        https://example.signalwire.com/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Recordings/{Sid}.mp3`


        ## Authenticated Access (Voice Scope Required)


        **Retrieve Metadata**


        A recording's metadata, such as duration, cost, time, can be returned by

        setting the Recording URI's extension to `.json`. This requires authentication

        with a Voice-scoped API token.


        `GET
        https://example.signalwire.com/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Recordings/{Sid}.json`


        #### Permissions

        The API token must include the following scopes: _Voice_. This permission is only required for authenticated requests to retrieve recording metadata (.json extension).
