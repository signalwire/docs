# Setting Up Voicemail

import Frame from "@site/src/components/Extras/Frame/Frame";

import LangSwitchMessage from "@site/docs/_common/languageSwitcher.mdx";

A popular and important use case is recording a voicemail from your callers when you are unable to speak with them. This guide will show how to do exactly that.

In this guide we will see how to implement a voicemail using Node.js. This allows you the most flexibility in case you want to integrate voicemails with complex workflows.

## Assigning a Phone Number to a Relay Context

To handle calls using Node.js, you should first set up a phone number to handle incoming calls using a Relay application.

Click the **Phone Numbers** tab on your lefthand side nav within your SignalWire Space, and click the specific number you would like to set up call forwarding on.
If you don't have a number yet, now is the time to [buy one][buy-one]!

<Frame caption = "To configure your number to handle incoming calls with a Relay application, set 'Handle calls using' to 'Relay Application', then specify the name of a context (here we choose 'office').">

## Building the application

Our phone number is now configured. Let's see how to build the voicemail with Node.js.

### Installation

First, you need to obtain the Realtime SDK. From your terminal you can run:

<Language groupId="relay_version">
<LangItem value="relayv3">

```shell npm2yarn
npm install --save @signalwire/realtime-api@~3
```

</LangItem>
<LangItem value="relayv4">

```shell npm2yarn
npm install --save @signalwire/realtime-api
```

</LangItem>
</Language>

This will install the Realtime SDK from npm into your project.

### Code

The first thing we need to do is to import the Realtime SDK and initialize a Voice client. We can do it like this:

<Language groupId="relay_version">
<LangItem value="relayv3">

```js
import { Voice } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = new Voice.Client({
  project: "<project-id>",
  token: "<api-token>",
  contexts: ["office"],
});
```

</LangItem>
<LangItem value="relayv4">

```js
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({
  project: "<project-id>",
  token: "<api-token>",
  topics: ["office"],
});

const voiceClient = client.voice;
```

</LangItem>
</Language>

We want to execute our logic whenever a call is received. Let's attach an
event handler to the `call.received` event, from which we can answer the call
and play a message:

<Language groupId="relay_version">
<LangItem value="relayv3">

```js
client.on("call.received", async (call) => {
  console.log("Got call", call.from, call.to);

  await call.answer();

  const tts = await call.playTTS({
    text: "Please leave a message with your name and number at the beep. Press the pound key when finished.",
  });
  await tts.waitForEnded();
});
```

</LangItem>
<LangItem value="relayv4">

```js
await voiceClient.listen({
  topics: ["office"],
  onCallReceived: async (call) => {
    console.log("Got call", call.from, call.to);

    await call.answer();

    await call.playTTS({
      text: "Please leave a message with your name and number at the beep. Press the pound key when finished.",
    });
  },
});
```

</LangItem>
</Language>

Right after playing the introduction message, we need to start recording. But
before that, let's set up an event listener within the `call.received` handler
which will notify us when the recording has ended:

<Language groupId="relay_version">
<LangItem value="relayv3">

```js
// inside the "call.received" event handler

call.on("recording.ended", async (rec) => {
  const tts = await call.playTTS({
    text: "Thank you for your message. A member of our team will contact you shortly. Goodbye!",
  });
  await tts.waitForEnded();

  console.log("Recording URL:", rec.url);

  await call.hangup();
});
```

</LangItem>
<LangItem value="relayv4">

```js
// inside the "call.received" event handler

await call
  .recordAudio({
    listen: {
      onEnded: async (rec) => {
        console.log("Recording URL:", rec.url);
        await call.playTTS({
          text: "Thank you for your message. A member of our team will contact you shortly. Goodbye!",
        });
        await call.hangup();
      },
    },
  })
  .onStarted();
```

</LangItem>
</Language>

We can finally start the recording. Since we also want the recording to be no
more than 15 seconds long, we will set a timeout which will stop it if it didn't
already end.

<Language>
<LangItem value="relayv3">

```js
const recording = await call.recordAudio({
  endSilenceTimeout: 0,
  terminators: "#",
});

// Stop the recording after 15 seconds.
setTimeout(() => recording.stop(), 15000);
```

</LangItem>
<LangItem value="relayv4">

```js
await call
  .recordAudio({
    endSilenceTimeout: 0,
    terminators: "#",
    listen: {
      onStarted: async (recording) => {
        // Stop the recording after 15 seconds.
        setTimeout(() => recording.stop(), 15000);
      },
    },
  })
  .onStarted();
```

</LangItem>
</Language>

Putting all of the parts together, here is the full code:

  console.log("Got call", call.from, call.to);

  await call.answer();

  const tts = await call.playTTS({
    text: "Please leave a message with your name and number at the beep. Press the pound key when finished.",
  });
  await tts.waitForEnded();

  // Callback to be executed when the recording ends.

## Wrapping up

The Realtime SDK allows you to build powerful applications with a simple API.
You are not limited to phone calls: you can also control messaging, chat, video,
and more. See all available options in the [Realtime SDK documentation][realtime-sdk-documentation].
