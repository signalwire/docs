# Overview

The Realtime SDK provides a unified client architecture that brings together various communication features into one client. 
This server-side solution streamlines the process of building real-time communication applications.

## **Installation**

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @signalwire/realtime-api
```

## **Getting started**

To get started, create a [Realtime-Client][realtime-client]

Once you have a client, you can then choose a namespace to work with. Each namespace
provides a set of methods to interact with the SignalWire RealTime APIs.

Here is an example of how to use the Voice namespace to make an outbound phone call:

```js
import { SignalWire, Voice } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const voiceClient = client.voice

try {
  const call = await voiceClient.dialPhone({
    from: "+YYYYYYYYYY",
    to: "+XXXXXXXXXX",
    timeout: 30
  });
  console.log("Call answered.", call);
} catch (e) {
  console.log("Call not answered.", e);
}
```

## **Namespaces**

- [Chat][chat]
- [Messaging][messaging]
- [PubSub][pubsub]
- [Task][task]
- [Video][video]
- [Voice][voice]
