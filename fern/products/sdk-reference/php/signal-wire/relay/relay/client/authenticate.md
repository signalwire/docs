# `authenticate`

Send the signalwire.connect RPC to authenticate and bind a session.

Sends project/token both at the top level AND nested under
`authentication`. Python sends the nested form; the audit fixture
accepts either; sending both is forward-compatible (per
SUBAGENT\_PLAYBOOK lessons-learned).

## Signature

```php
public function authenticate(): void
```

## Source
