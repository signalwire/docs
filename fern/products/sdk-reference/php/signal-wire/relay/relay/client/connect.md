# `connect`

Open the WebSocket connection and run the JSON-RPC `signalwire.connect`

handshake. Throws on transport or auth failure.

The transport URI is `<scheme>://<host><relayPath>` (defaults to
`wss://<host>/api/relay/ws`). Tests point SIGNALWIRE\_RELAY\_SCHEME
at `ws` and SIGNALWIRE\_RELAY\_HOST at the fixture's host:port.

## Signature

```php
public function connect(): void
```
