# `main`

Example: rest\_audit\_harness

Audit-only harness — drives a single REST operation against the loopback fixture spun up by porting-sdk's audit\_rest\_transport.py. Reads:

- REST\_OPERATION e.g. "calling.list\_calls", "messaging.send"
- REST\_FIXTURE\_URL "http://127.0.0.1:NNNN"
- REST\_OPERATION\_ARGS JSON dict (forwarded to the operation)
- SIGNALWIRE\_PROJECT\_ID, SIGNALWIRE\_API\_TOKEN, SIGNALWIRE\_SPACE

Behavior: constructs a RestClient, overrides its base URL with REST\_FIXTURE\_URL, dispatches the operation, prints the parsed response as JSON to stdout, exits 0 on success / non-zero on error.

Operation mapping: the audit operations are dotted names that don't always 1:1 with Go method names. The mapping below routes each dotted name to the appropriate Go REST method:

- calling.list\_calls → Compat.Calls.List (LAML endpoint)
- messaging.send → Compat.Messages.Create
- phone\_numbers.list → PhoneNumbers.List
- fabric.subscribers.list → Fabric.Subscribers.List
- compatibility.calls.list → Compat.Calls.List

The Calling namespace in Go (and Python) is for relay-native command dispatch (POST /api/calling/calls), not for listing LAML-style calls. The audit's `calling.list_calls` is interpreted as the LAML endpoint because that's the only "list calls" operation the SDK exposes.

Not for production use.
