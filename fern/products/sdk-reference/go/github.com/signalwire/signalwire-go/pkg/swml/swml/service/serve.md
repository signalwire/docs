# `Serve`

Serve starts the HTTP server. This is a blocking call.

When TLS is configured via WithTLS (or SWML\_SSL\_CERT\_PATH / SWML\_SSL\_KEY\_PATH env vars), ListenAndServeTLS is called automatically. Mirrors Python's serve() ssl\_cert / ssl\_key / ssl\_enabled parameter support.

If SWAIG\_LIST\_TOOLS is set in the environment, Serve() does NOT bind a port; instead it prints the registered tool registry sandwiched by **SWAIG\_TOOLS\_BEGIN** / **SWAIG\_TOOLS\_END** sentinels to stdout and exits 0. This is how `swaig-test --example NAME` introspects a SWMLService-only binary without HTTP-walking rendered SWML.

## Signature

```go
func (*Service) Serve() error
```

## Returns

`error`
