# `OnSwmlRequestHook`

OnSwmlRequestHook is the function-field hook that user code can set to override the default SWML-request customization behavior. Returning a non-nil map applies modifications to the rendered SWML; returning nil uses the default rendering unchanged.

Python parity: web\_mixin.WebMixin.on\_swml\_request — Go has no method inheritance, so we expose the override as a settable function field.

## Signature

```go
type OnSwmlRequestHook alias
```
