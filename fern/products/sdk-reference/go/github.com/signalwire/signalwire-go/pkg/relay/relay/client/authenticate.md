# `Authenticate`

Authenticate runs the signalwire.connect handshake and stores the server-issued protocol string. Mirrors Python's RelayClient.connect() auth phase. Use Connect first to establish the WebSocket; this call reads the auth response synchronously (the read loop has not yet started so no other reader is contending for the socket).

## Signature

```go
func (*Client) Authenticate() error
```

## Returns

`error`
