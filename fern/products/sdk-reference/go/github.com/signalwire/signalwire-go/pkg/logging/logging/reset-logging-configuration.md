# `ResetLoggingConfiguration`

ResetLoggingConfiguration re-reads SIGNALWIRE\_LOG\_LEVEL and SIGNALWIRE\_LOG\_MODE from the environment and resets globalLevel and suppressed to the env-derived defaults. It is the Go equivalent of Python's reset\_logging\_configuration() and is intended for test teardown and env-var-driven reconfiguration at runtime.

## Signature

```go
func ResetLoggingConfiguration()
```
