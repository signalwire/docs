# `ListSkillsWithParams`

ListSkillsWithParams returns the complete parameter schema for all registered skills. It instantiates each skill with nil params to obtain its GetParameterSchema output. This mirrors Python's skill\_registry.get\_all\_skills\_schema(). The returned map has skill names as keys and their parameter schemas as values.

## Signature

```go
func ListSkillsWithParams() map[string]map[string]map[string]any
```

## Returns

`map[string]map[string]map[string]any`
