# `to_yaml`

Render the model as a YAML string. Matches PyYAML's output
shape (`default_flow_style=False, sort_keys=False`).

We hand-emit YAML rather than rely on `serde_yaml::to_string`
because the latter (a) sorts keys alphabetically when fed a
`serde_json::Value` (which uses BTreeMap internally) and
(b) doesn't expose a switch to disable that. The POM
document shape is fully constrained — list of dicts with
known string/list-of-string/list-of-dict values — so a
targeted emitter is straightforward and guarantees parity.

## Signature

```rust
fn to_yaml(&self) -> ?<?, ?>
```

## Returns

`?<?, ?>`
