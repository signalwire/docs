# `bump_reconnect_delay`

Compute the next reconnect delay (1s → 2s → 4s → … → 30s) and
return the value to wait _this_ time. Mirrors Python's
`RECONNECT_MIN_DELAY` / `RECONNECT_MAX_DELAY` / backoff factor.
Exposed (and tested) separately from \[`reconnect`] so the math
is verifiable without opening a real socket.

## Signature

```rust
fn bump_reconnect_delay(&self) -> u64
```

## Returns

`u64`
