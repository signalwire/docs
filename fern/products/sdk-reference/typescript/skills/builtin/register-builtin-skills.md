# `registerBuiltinSkills`

Register all 19 built-in skills with the global SkillRegistry singleton.
Matches Python's auto-discovery pattern (`skills/registry.py`) which finds
SkillBase subclasses in the skills directory and registers them by class
reference. Skips registration for any skill name already present.

## Signature

```typescript
registerBuiltinSkills(): void
```

## Returns

`void`
