# `setup`

Setup the skill. Called when the skill is added to an agent.
Override to perform initialization (API connections, config validation, etc.)

## Signature

```typescript
setup(): Promise<boolean>
```

## Returns

`Promise<boolean>` — `true` if setup succeeded, `false` otherwise. Python equivalent: abstract `setup() -> bool`.
