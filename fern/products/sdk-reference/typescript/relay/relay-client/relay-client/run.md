# `run`

Blocking entry point — connects and maintains the connection with
auto-reconnect, returning only after a clean shutdown (Ctrl+C, SIGTERM,
or [disconnect](/reference/typescript/relay/relay-client/relay-client/disconnect) from another scope).

Installs `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` handlers, so typically only one `RelayClient`
per process should call `run()`.

## Signature

```typescript
run(): Promise<void>
```

## Returns

`Promise<void>` — Resolves once a shutdown has been requested and cleanup completes.

## Throws

- Only on unrecoverable startup failures — normal disconnects are handled internally by the reconnect loop.
