# `disconnect`

Cleanly close the connection.

Stops the ping loop, drops the WebSocket, rejects every pending request
and dial with a `Connection closed` [RelayError](/reference/typescript/relay/relay-error), and removes the
client from the process-wide active set. Safe to call repeatedly.

## Signature

```typescript
disconnect(): Promise<void>
```

## Returns

`Promise<void>` — Resolves once all resources have been released.
