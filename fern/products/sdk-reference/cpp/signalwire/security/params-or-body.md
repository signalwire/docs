# `ParamsOrBody`

Drop-in shape for ValidateRequest mirroring @signalwire/compatibility-api's RestClient.validateRequest: either a raw body string (delegates to the combined validator) or a pre-parsed form-params list (runs Scheme B directly).

## Signature

```cpp
typedef std::variant< std::string, FormParams > ParamsOrBody
```

## Source

[`include/signalwire/security/webhook_validator.hpp`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-cpp/blob/main/include/signalwire/security/webhook_validator.hpp)

Line 38.
