# `EventHandler`

Generic callback for any inbound signalwire.event. Fired in addition to the typed handlers (on\_call, on\_message, action callbacks). Useful for tracing and for tests/audits that need to assert event delivery.

## Signature

```cpp
typedef std::function< void(const RelayEvent &)> EventHandler
```

## Source

[`include/signalwire/relay/client.hpp`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-cpp/blob/main/include/signalwire/relay/client.hpp)

Line 37.
