# Switching Webcams or Microphones During a Call

SignalWire Video API allows you to host real-time video calls and conferences on your website. In this guide, we'll learn to allow users to change the camera and microphone that's being used in the call.

## Getting Started

It is very easy to switch between input devices once you have the SDK up and running. However, if you haven't yet set up a video conference project using the Video SDK, you can check out the [Simple Video Demo](/video/getting-started/simple-video-demo) guide first.

## Getting a list of supported input devices

First, we want to find out what devices are available as input. Getting the list of media devices is handled by the `WebRTC` object available via `SignalWire.WebRTC` from the SDK. The methods in the `WebRTC` allow you to get the list of microphones, cameras, and speakers.

### Listing webcams

To get the list of connected devices that can be used via the browser, we use
the `getCameraDevicesWithPermissions()` method in `WebRTC`. The method returns
an array of
[InputDeviceInfo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/InputDeviceInfo)
object, each of which have two attributes of interest to us here:
`InputDeviceInfo.deviceId` and `InputDeviceInfo.label`. The `label` will be used
to refer to the webcam via the UI, and looks like 'Facetime HD Camera' or 'USB
camera'. The `deviceId` is used in your code to address a particular device.

```javascript
const cams = await SignalWire.WebRTC.getCameraDevicesWithPermissions();
cams.forEach((cam) => {
  console.log(cam.label, cam.deviceId);
});
```

### Listing microphones

Exactly as with `getCameraDevicesWithPermissions()`, we can use the `getMicrophoneDevicesWithPermissions()` to get a list of allowed microphones.

```javascript
const mics = await SignalWire.WebRTC.getMicrophoneDevicesWithPermissions();
mics.forEach((mic) => {
  console.log(mic.label, mic.deviceId);
});
```

## Changing webcams and microphones

Once you have set up the video call with `SignalWire.Video.joinRoom()` or
equivalent methods, we can use `Room.updateCamera()` and
`Room.updateMicrophone()` to change devices.

As a simplified example:

```javascript
const roomSession = new SignalWire.Video.RoomSession({
  token,
  rootElement: document.getElementById("root"), // an html element to display the video
  iceGatheringTimeout: 0.01,
  requestTimeout: 0.01,
});

try {
  await roomSession.join();
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error", error);
}

const cams = await SignalWire.WebRTC.getCameraDevicesWithPermissions();
const mics = await SignalWire.WebRTC.getMicrophoneDevicesWithPermissions();

// Pick the first camera in the list as the new video input device
roomSession.updateCamera({
  deviceId: cams[0].deviceId,
});

// Pick the first microphone in the list as the new audio input device
roomSession.updateMicrophone({
  deviceId: mics[0].deviceId,
});
```

_Note that you don't explicitly have to update camera and microphone. SignalWire Video SDK chooses the preferred input devices by default on setup. Only `updateCamera` or `updateMicrophone` when you want to switch to a non-default device._

## A complete code example

A complete demo of switching between examples is available for you to read and experiment on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/lingering-glitter-r8bxl). You can tinker with the code without leaving your browser. The functions of interest to us here are at `src/frontend/index.js`. Look for functions `populateMicrophone()` and `populateCamera()`.
