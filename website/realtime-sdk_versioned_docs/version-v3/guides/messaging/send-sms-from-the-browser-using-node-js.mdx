This guide will use SignalWire's Messaging API to create a simple web application that can send SMS through the browser.

## What do I need?

Find the full code on Github [here][here].

You will need the [SignalWire Realtime SDK][signalwire-realtime-sdk-1] running on Node.js. It'll help if you are familiar with the Express framework.

Additionally, you will need a SignalWire account which you can create [here][here-2]. From your SignalWire Space, you need your [SignalWire API credentials][navigating-your-signalwire-space].

## Trying it out

### Run Natively

Navigate to [this project][this-project]
in the SignalWire Guides GitHub Repo, and follow the instructions in README.md.

:::info This example should not be used in a live environment

Exposing this web app to a live endpoint means anybody with the URL could send SMS requests through your SignalWire Space.

## Code Walkthrough

The main code for this demo (`index.js`) is a very simple file server with a minimal backend with a single route (`/sendSMS`). The file server delivers `index.html` to the user's browser.

To perform API calls to the SignalWire servers, we need to send some authentication information: Project ID and the API token. This information is sensitive, so we take special precautions in storing them. We keep them in the `.env` file and add a rule on `.gitignore` to not push the `.env` file to GitHub. And while we're at it, we also store the phone number in the `.env` file, for ease of maintenance.

### Server-side code

#### Set-up

The server-side code for this is very simple. First, we will import the required packages, set our environment variables, and create a client that will handle our SMS requests.

```javascript
require("dotenv").config();
const { Messaging } = require("@signalwire/realtime-api");

const sendingPhoneNumber = process.env.PHONE_NUMBER;

const client = new Messaging.Client({
  project: process.env.PROJECT_ID,
  token: process.env.API_TOKEN,
});
```

#### Index Route

Next, we will write some code to serve the client-side code (`index.html`). When integrating this project, this may not be needed depending on how you're hosting the frontend.

```javascript
app.use("/", express.static("html")); // serve the html folder
```

#### Create SMS Handler Route

Finally, for our server-side, we will create a route that actually handles the creation of our SMS requests to the client. We'll name it `/sendSMS`.

First, we get the destination phone number and the SMS body from the client. We need to make sure that the values are legitimate. In particular, we need to make sure the phone number is in the required E.164 format. To do so, we call the `isE164PhoneNumber()` function provided by the `is-e164-phone-number` package on NPM. You can, of course, choose to validate the numbers however you like, including regular expressions. You might also want to verify that the destination country code is supported by you.

We will try to send the message we retrieved from the client, and return a confirmation to the client. In this case, there is no validation if a message was delivered successfully, only that the request was created.

Alternatively, if our conditions aren't met, we just assume something went wrong and return an error message to the client.

While the rest of the parameters to `client.send` (`body`, `to`, `from`) are self-explanatory, the `context` parameter needs an introduction. It is used to segregate calls and messages (so you can, for example, subscribe to events from a group of phone numbers in the same context). For further information, please read the [Realtime SDK][realtime-sdk-1] documentation.

```javascript
app.post("/sendSMS", async (req, res) => {
  let { phoneno, body } = req.body;
  if (typeof body !== "string" || body === "") return res.send("Invalid body");
  if (!isE164PhoneNumber(phoneno)) return res.send("Invalid Phone Number");

  console.log("Sending message to phone number", phoneno);
  try {
    const status = await client.send({
      context: "office",
      from: sendingPhoneNumber, // The number you bought from SignalWire
      to: phoneno,
      body,
    });

    console.log(status);
    return res.send("Your SMS was sent");
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    return res.send("Error sending SMS");
  }
});
```

### Client-side Code

Our client-side code is just a simple HTML file `index.html` and its styling in `index.css`.

Most of this code is just the default/boilerplate HTML. The heart of our client boils down to the `<body>`.

First, we will create a new `<form>` with the action URL being our `/sendSMS` route. Note that we want to send the information as a POST request to `/sendSMS` route, which will be received by the `app.post('/sendSMS', ...)` function above.

There we add two input fields, one for the destination phone number and one for the text. A button submits the information to the server.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>SMS with SignalWire RealTime API</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="index.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="body">
      <form method="POST" action="/sendSMS">
        <h1>Send an SMS with SignalWire</h1>
        <label>Phone Number</label>
        <input type="input" placeholder="E.164 number like +18001234567" name="phoneno" />
        <br />
        <br />
        Message:
        <textarea name="body"></textarea>
        <button>Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css index.css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
.body {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
form {
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
}

label {
  width: 100%;
}
input {
  width: 100%;
}
textarea {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 100%;
  min-width: 100%;
  max-height: 300px;
}
```

## Wrap Up

This is a simple and flexible way to allow data to be passed from the client to your server which can then be validated before we create requests to the SignalWire API! While this guide focuses on SMS, this same principle can be used to implement a wide variety of features into your web app!
