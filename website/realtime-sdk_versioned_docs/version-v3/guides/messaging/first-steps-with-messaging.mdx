Send and receive SMS messages from your own Node.js application.

## Installation

First, you need to obtain the Realtime SDK. If you are using npm or yarn, from
your terminal you can run the following command:

```shell npm2yarn
npm install @signalwire/realtime-api@~3
```

Then, you can include the package in JavaScript as follows:

```js
import { Messaging } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";
```

## Obtaining and configuring a number

[Log in][log-in] to your SignalWire Space.
From the Phone Numbers section, you can
[buy a new phone number][buy-a-new-phone-number].
You will need at least one number to send and receive messages.
After you have acquired a number, open its settings by clicking on "Edit Settings".
Scroll down until you reach "Messaging Settings", as shown in the next figure, and configure it to:

- handle messages using a RELAY application,
- forward the call to the "office" RELAY context

:::info Context
In RELAY V3, a context is a named scope that allows you to group resources together. 
When you configure a phone number to handle messages with a RELAY application 
and specify a context, all messages to that number will be delivered to RELAY 
clients listening on that context.

:::info Ensuring message delivery

If you are sending messages to the US from a 10DLC number, you _must_ register your traffic with the Campaign Registry.
Otherwise, the carriers will not deliver your messages.
Please see our [**Campaign Registry - Everything You Need To Know**][campaign-registry-everything-you-need-to-know]
guide for more information.

## Sending your first message

To send a message from Node.js you need to instantiate a Messaging client, and then call its `send` method.

```js
import { Messaging } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = new Messaging.Client({
  project: "your-project-id",
  token: "your-api-token",
  contexts: ["office"],
});

try {
  const status = await client.send({
    context: "office",
    from: "+1xxx", // The number you bought from SignalWire
    to: "+1yyy",
    body: "Hello World!",
  });

  console.log(status);
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

We used the "office" context in two places:
first, when initializing the Messaging client.
Then, when calling `send`.
You use the `contexts` array in the Client constructor to specify the list of contexts you want to listen to for events.
Instead, the `context` in the `send` method determines the `context` to associate to the message.
If the two contexts match, your Client will receive events (`message.updated`) for this outgoing message too.

You also need to specify a Project ID and API token: find these in the API
section of your Space, as shown in the following figure. Make sure that your
token has the "Messaging" scope enabled.

## Receiving incoming messages

Once a Client is initialized, you can listen for incoming messages on the
selected contexts (in our example, just "office"). For example:

```js
client.on("message.received", (message) => {
  console.log("Message received:", message);
});
```

Your event handler receives a message object, which you can use to access fields
such as `message.body`, `message.from`, `message.to`, etc.

## Next steps

Congratulations!
You can now send and receive messages with your Node.js application.
You are now ready to explore the advanced guides in the Messaging section from the left menu.
