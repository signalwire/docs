A `Relay.Task` is simple way to send jobs to your [`Relay.Consumers`][relay-consumers] from a short lived process, like a web framework. RELAY Tasks allow you to pass commands down to your Consumers without blocking your short lived request. Think of a RELAY Task as a way to queue a job for your background workers to processes asynchronously.

## Creating Tasks

A Task is a simple object with 2 required arguments: `$project` and `$token`. Project and Token are used to send the Task to your Consumers. Once created, the Task has only one method `deliver` to send jobs to your Consumer.

```php
<?php

require dirname(__FILE__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use SignalWire\Relay\Tasking\Task;

$task = new Task('XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX', 'PTXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX');
$context = 'office';
$delivered = $task->deliver($context, [
  'key' => 'value',
  'data' => 'data for your job'
]);
```

## Methods

### deliver

Send a job to your `Consumer` in a specific context.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `$context` | `string` | **required** | Context where to send the Task. |
| `$message` | `array` | **required** | Array with your custom data that will be sent to your Consumer's [`onTask`][consumer] handler. |

**Returns**

`boolean` - Whether the Task has been sent successfully.

**Examples**

Deliver a task to your Consumer with a message to then make an outbound Call.

```php
<?php

$delivered = $task->deliver('office', [
  'action' => 'call',
  'from' => '+18881112222'
  'to' => '+18881113333'
]);
```
