A `Relay::Task` is simple way to send jobs to your [`Relay.Consumers`][relay-consumers] from a short lived process, like a web framework. RELAY Tasks allow you to pass commands down to your Consumers without blocking your short lived request. Think of a RELAY Task as a way to queue a job for your background workers to processes asynchronously.

## Creating Tasks

A Task is a simple object with 2 required arguments: `project` and `token`. Project and Token are used to send the Task to your Consumers. Once created, the Task has only one method `deliver` to send jobs to your Consumer.

```ruby
require 'signalwire/relay/task'

task = Signalwire::Relay::Task.new(project: "your-project-id", token: "your-project-token")
task.deliver(context: 'incoming', message: { number_to_call: '+1555XXXXXXX', message_to_play: 'We have a message for you' })
```

## Methods

### deliver

Send a job to your `Consumer` in a specific context.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `context` | String | Yes | Context where to send the Task. |
| `message` | Hash | Yes | Object with your custom data that will be sent to your Consumer's [`on_task`][consumer] handler. |

**Returns**

`Boolean` - `true` if the request was successful, `false` if not.

**Examples**

Deliver a task to your Consumer with a message to then make an outbound Call.

```ruby
message = {
  'action': 'call',
  'from': '+18881112222'
  'to': '+18881113333'
}

result = task.deliver(context: 'incoming', message: message)

puts "error delivering task" if result == false
```
