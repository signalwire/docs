# Make sure you have attached the listeners you need before connecting the client, or you might miss some events.
client.connect!
```

### disconnect!

**Returns**

`nil`

**Examples**

```ruby
client.disconnect!
```

### on

Attach an event handler for a specific type of event.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `event` | Symbol | Yes | Event name. Full list of events [RELAY Client Events][link] |
| `guards` | Array | No | Guard clauses for the event. |
| `handler` | Block | No | Block to call when the event is received. It will be passed in as an argument. |

**Returns**

`String` - A low-level handler ID.

**Examples**

Subscribe to the `ready` event.

client.on :ready do
  # do something on ready
end
```
