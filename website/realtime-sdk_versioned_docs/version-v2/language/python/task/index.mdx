## Relay.Task

A [`Relay.Task`][relay-task] is simple way to send jobs to your [`Relay.Consumers`][relay-consumer] from a short lived process, like a web framework. RELAY Tasks allow you to pass commands down to your Consumers without blocking your short lived request. Think of a RELAY Task as a way to queue a job for your background workers to processes asynchronously.

### Creating Tasks

A Task is a simple object with 2 required arguments: `project` and `token`. Project and Token are used to send the Task to your Consumers. Once created, the Task has only one method `deliver` to send jobs to your Consumer.

```python
from signalwire.relay.task import Task

task = Task(project='<my-project>', token='<my-token>')
success = task.deliver('context-here', { 'key': 'random data' })
```

## Methods

### deliver

Send a job to your [`Consumer`][relay-consumer] in a specific context.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `context` | `string` | **required** | Context where to send the Task. |
| `message` | `dict` | **required** | Dict with your custom data that will be sent to your [`Consumer's`][relay-consumer] `onTask` method. |

**Returns**

`coroutine` - Coroutine that will be fulfilled with a boolean value.

**Examples**

Deliver a task to your Consumer with a message to then make an outbound Call:

```python
from signalwire.relay.task import Task

project = 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX'
token = 'PTXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
task = Task(project=project, token=token)
data = {
  'action': 'call',
  'from': '+18881112222'
  'to': '+18881113333'
}
success = task.deliver('office', data)
if success:
  print('Task delivered')
else:
  print('Task not delivered')
```
