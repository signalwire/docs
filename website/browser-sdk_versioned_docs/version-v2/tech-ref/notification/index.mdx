| `refreshToken` | The JWT is going to expire. Refresh it or your session will be disconnected. |
| `callUpdate` | A Call's state has been changed. Update the UI accordingly. |
| `participantData` | New participant's data (i.e. name, number) to update the UI. |
| `userMediaError` | The browser does not have permission to access media devices. Check the `audio` and `video` constraints you are using. |
