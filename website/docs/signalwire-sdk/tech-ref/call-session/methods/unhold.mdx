Resumes the call from hold by restoring outbound audio and video from the local participant.

## Signature

```typescript
call.unhold(): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Put call on hold
await call.hold()

// Resume the call
await call.unhold()
```

## Important Notes

**What Happens on Unhold:**
- Your outbound audio and video streams are restored
- You resume sending audio/video to other participants
- Other participants can now see and hear you again
- The call returns to its normal active state

**Restores Previous State:** The call is restored to the state it was in before being put on hold. If audio or video were muted before hold, they will remain muted after unhold.

**Must Be On Hold:** This method should only be called when the call is currently on hold (after calling `hold()`). Calling it on an already active call has no effect.

**Automatic Media Resumption:** The SDK automatically:
- Restores audio/video tracks
- Re-enables media streaming
- Updates the UI state (if using framework integration)
