Unmutes incoming audio so you or another participant can hear others in the call again.

## Signature

```typescript
undeaf(params?: MemberCommandParams): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="MemberCommandParams">
  Configuration for the undeaf operation.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.memberId" type="string" default="Your member ID">
  Member to undeaf. Omit to undeaf yourself, provide specific ID to undeaf another member.
</APIField>

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Permissions

- **Undeaf yourself:** Requires `call.capabilities.self.deaf.off`
- **Undeaf another member:** Requires `call.capabilities.member.deaf.off`

## Events

- [`member.updated`][event-member-updated] - General member update event
- [`member.updated.deaf`][event-member-updated-deaf] - Specific event for deaf state change

## Important Notes

**Microphone Remains Muted:**

When you call `undeaf()`, the microphone remains muted. You must manually call `audioUnmute()` to speak again.

```typescript
// Step 1: Resume hearing others
await call.undeaf()
console.log('You can hear others now')

// Step 2: Manually unmute microphone to speak
await call.audioUnmute()
console.log('You can now hear and speak')
```

This is intentional - it gives you control over when you want to start speaking again.

**Member Targeting:**

The `memberId` parameter follows the standard member targeting pattern:
- **No parameter** - Undeafs yourself
- **Specific member ID** - Undeafs that member (requires permission)

```typescript
// Undeaf yourself
await call.undeaf()

// Undeaf a specific member
await call.undeaf({ memberId: 'de550c0c-3fac-4efd-b06f-b5b8614b8966' })
```

**Resume Participation Workflow:**

```typescript
async function resumeFullParticipation() {
  try {
    // Step 1: Resume hearing
    await call.undeaf()
    console.log('Can hear others')

    // Step 2: Resume speaking
    await call.audioUnmute()
    console.log('Can speak')

    console.log('Fully rejoined the conversation')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to resume participation:', error)
  }
}

resumeFullParticipation()
```

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Undeaf yourself (resume hearing others)
await call.undeaf()

// Manually unmute audio to speak
await call.audioUnmute()

// Undeaf another member (requires permission)
await call.undeaf({ memberId: 'member-id' })
```
