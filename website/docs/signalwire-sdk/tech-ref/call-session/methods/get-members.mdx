## Important Notes

**Real-time Updates:** `getMembers()` returns a snapshot of members at the time it's called. For real-time updates, listen to member events:

```typescript
call.on('member.joined', (event) => {
  console.log('Member joined:', event.member.name)
})

call.on('member.left', (event) => {
  console.log('Member left:', event.member.id)
})

call.on('member.updated', (event) => {
  console.log('Member updated:', event.member.name)
})
```

**Getting Your Own Member:** Your own member is included in the members array:

```typescript
const { members } = await call.getMembers()
const me = members.find(m => m.id === call.memberId)

if (me) {
  console.log('My name:', me.name)
  console.log('Am I muted?', me.audioMuted)
}
```

## Events

Several events involve member information:
- [`member.joined`][event-member-joined] - New member joined the call
- [`member.left`][event-member-left] - Member left the call
- [`member.updated`][event-member-updated] - Member state changed
- [`member.updated.audioMuted`][event-member-updated-audiomuted] - Audio mute state changed
- [`member.updated.videoMuted`][event-member-updated-videomuted] - Video mute state changed
- [`member.talking`][event-member-talking] - Member started or stopped talking
- [`memberList.updated`][event-memberlist-updated] - Batch update of multiple members

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Get all members in the call
const { members } = await call.getMembers()
console.log(`There are ${members.length} participants in the call`)

members.forEach(member => {
  console.log(`Member: ${member.name} (ID: ${member.id})`)
})
```
