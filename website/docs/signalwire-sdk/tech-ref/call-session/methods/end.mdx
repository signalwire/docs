[event-member-left]: /sdks/signalwire-sdk/call-session/events#memberleft

Ends the call for yourself or another participant, disconnecting them completely.

## Signature

```typescript
end(params?: MemberCommandParams): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="MemberCommandParams">
  Configuration object.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.memberId" type="string" default="Your member ID">
  Member to end the call for. Omit to end your own call, provide specific ID to end another member's call.
</APIField>

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Important Notes

**end() vs hangup() vs leave():**

| Method | Effect | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `end()` | Ends call for yourself or another member | General disconnect, can target specific members |
| `hangup()` | Ends your own call | Explicitly disconnect yourself |
| `leave()` | Alias for `hangup()` | Same as hangup, more semantic name |

**When to use each:**

```typescript
// End your own call
await call.end()        // ✅ Works
await call.hangup()     // ✅ Works (more explicit)
await call.leave()      // ✅ Works (semantic alias)

// End another member's call
await call.end({ memberId: 'member-123' })  // ✅ Works
await call.removeMember({ memberId: 'member-123' })  // ✅ Alternative method
```

**end() vs removeMember():**

Both methods can disconnect a participant:

| Method | Purpose | Semantic Meaning |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `end()` | End the call for a member | Terminate their call session |
| `removeMember()` | Remove a member from the call | Kick them out / moderate |

**Recommendation:** Use `removeMember()` for moderation actions (kicking users), and `end()` for general disconnection.

**Cleanup Behavior:** When you end your own call:
- WebRTC connection is closed
- All media streams are stopped
- Screen shares are automatically stopped
- Event listeners remain active (clean them up manually if needed)

## Events

When a call is ended, the following events may fire:
- [`call.left`][event-call-left] - Participant has left the call
- [`member.left`][event-member-left] - Member has been removed from the call

```typescript
call.on('member.left', (event) => {
  console.log(`Member ${event.member.id} left the call`)
})
```

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// End your own call
await call.end()

// Or end another participant's call
await call.end({ memberId: 'member-uuid' })
```
