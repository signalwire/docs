import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Retrieves detailed information about a specific address by its ID.

## How it works

The `address.getAddress` method queries the SignalWire platform for details about a single address. This provides comprehensive information about a specific phone number or endpoint.

## Key concepts

### Address details

The response includes:
- Address ID
- Phone number or SIP address
- Address type
- Display name
- Capabilities
- Configuration settings

### Use cases

Retrieve specific address details for:
- Displaying address information
- Validating address capabilities
- Configuration management
- Call routing decisions

## Parameters

<APIField name="addressId" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the address to retrieve.
</APIField>

## Signature

```typescript
address.getAddress(addressId: string): Promise<GetAddressResult>
```

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<GetAddressResult>`

Returns a Promise that resolves with detailed information about the requested address.

## Examples

### Get address by ID

```typescript
const address = await client.address.getAddress('address-id-here')

console.log('Address:', address.number)
console.log('Type:', address.type)
```

### Display address details

```typescript
const address = await client.address.getAddress('address-id-here')

console.log('Address Details:')
console.log('  Number:', address.number)
console.log('  Name:', address.name)
console.log('  Type:', address.type)
console.log('  Capabilities:', address.capabilities)
```

### Validate address capabilities

```typescript
const address = await client.address.getAddress('address-id-here')

if (address.capabilities.canReceiveCalls) {
  console.log('This address can receive incoming calls')
}

if (address.capabilities.canSendSMS) {
  console.log('This address can send SMS messages')
}
```

### Error handling

```typescript
try {
  const address = await client.address.getAddress('address-id')
  console.log('Address found:', address.number)
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Address not found:', error)
}
```

### Get address from selection

```typescript
const selectedId = document.getElementById('address-select').value

if (selectedId) {
  const address = await client.address.getAddress(selectedId)
  
  document.getElementById('address-display').textContent = address.number
  document.getElementById('address-type').textContent = address.type
}
```

### Check if address exists

```typescript
async function addressExists(addressId) {
  try {
    await client.address.getAddress(addressId)
    return true
  } catch (error) {
    return false
  }
}

const exists = await addressExists('address-id')
console.log('Address exists:', exists)
```

### Compare addresses

```typescript
const address1 = await client.address.getAddress('address-1-id')
const address2 = await client.address.getAddress('address-2-id')

console.log('Comparing addresses:')
console.log(`Address 1: ${address1.number} (${address1.type})`)
console.log(`Address 2: ${address2.number} (${address2.type})`)
```

### Use address for calling

```typescript
const address = await client.address.getAddress('my-address-id')

const callSession = await client.dial({
  to: '+15551234567',
  from: address.number
})

console.log('Calling from:', address.number)
```
