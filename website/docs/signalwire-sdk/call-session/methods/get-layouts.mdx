[event-layout-changed]: /sdks/signalwire-sdk/call-session/events#layoutchanged

Retrieves a list of available video layouts for the call.

## Signature

```typescript
getLayouts(): Promise<{ layouts: string[] }>
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<{ layouts: string[] }>`

An object containing an array of layout name strings.

**Common layout names include:**
- `"grid-responsive"` - Responsive grid layout
- `"2x1"`, `"3x3"`, `"4x4"`, `"5x5"`, `"6x6"` - Fixed grid layouts
- `"1x1"` - Single participant layout
- `"2x2"` - Four participant grid

## Important Notes

**Layout Availability:** The list of available layouts depends on your server configuration and call settings. Common layouts include:

| Layout Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `grid-responsive` | Automatically adjusts grid based on number of participants |
| `1x1` | Single participant (full screen) |
| `2x1` | Two participants side by side |
| `2x2` | Four participants in a 2x2 grid |
| `3x3` | Nine participants in a 3x3 grid |
| `4x4` | Sixteen participants in a 4x4 grid |
| `5x5` | Twenty-five participants in a 5x5 grid |
| `6x6` | Thirty-six participants in a 6x6 grid |

**Tip:** Use `grid-responsive` for most use cases as it automatically adapts to the number of participants.

**Layout vs Position:**
- **Layout** - The overall arrangement template (e.g., `3x3` grid)
- **Position** - Where a specific participant appears within that layout

```typescript
// Set the layout template
await call.setLayout({ name: '3x3' })

// Optionally set specific member positions within the layout
await call.setPositions({
  positions: {
    [memberId1]: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    [memberId2]: { x: 1, y: 0 }
  }
})
```

## Events

While `getLayouts()` doesn't emit events, layout changes emit:

- [`layout.changed`][event-layout-changed] - Fired when the call layout changes

```typescript
call.on('layout.changed', (event) => {
  console.log('New layout:', event.layout.name)
  console.log('Layout layers:', event.layout.layers)
})
```

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Get available layouts
const { layouts } = await call.getLayouts()
console.log('Available layouts:', layouts)
// Example output: ["grid-responsive", "2x2", "3x3", "4x4", "6x6"]
```
