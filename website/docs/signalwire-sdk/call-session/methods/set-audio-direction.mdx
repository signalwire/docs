import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Sets the direction of the audio track in the WebRTC connection by performing RTC peer renegotiation.

## Signature

```typescript
call.setAudioDirection(direction: UpdateMediaDirection): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

<APIField name="direction" type="UpdateMediaDirection" required>
  The desired audio direction. Valid values: `'sendrecv'`, `'sendonly'`, `'recvonly'`, `'inactive'`
</APIField>

**UpdateMediaDirection** values:
- `'sendrecv'` - Send and receive audio (default, two-way audio)
- `'sendonly'` - Only send audio, don't receive
- `'recvonly'` - Only receive audio, don't send
- `'inactive'` - Neither send nor receive audio

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Important Notes

**Peer Renegotiation:** This method triggers WebRTC peer renegotiation to update the audio track direction. The connection will temporarily adjust while renegotiating.

**Direction vs Mute:**
- **Mute** (`audioMute()`): Temporarily stops sending audio, but the track remains active
- **Direction**: Changes the fundamental audio flow in the WebRTC connection

Use `setAudioDirection()` when you need to:
- Permanently disable audio sending or receiving
- Optimize bandwidth by not receiving audio when unnecessary
- Implement broadcast or listen-only modes

Use `audioMute()`/`audioUnmute()` when you just need to temporarily stop sending audio.

**Video Unaffected:** This method only changes the audio direction. Video direction remains unchanged. To update both, use `updateMedia()`.

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Enable two-way audio
await call.setAudioDirection('sendrecv')

// Listen-only mode
await call.setAudioDirection('recvonly')

// Broadcast mode (send only)
await call.setAudioDirection('sendonly')

// Disable audio completely
await call.setAudioDirection('inactive')
```
