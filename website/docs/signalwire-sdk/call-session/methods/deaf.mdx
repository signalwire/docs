import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

[event-member-updated]: /sdks/signalwire-sdk/call-session/events#memberupdated
[event-member-updated-deaf]: /sdks/signalwire-sdk/call-session/events#memberupdateddeaf
[event-member-updated-audiomuted]: /sdks/signalwire-sdk/call-session/events#memberupdatedaudiomuted

Mutes incoming audio so you or another participant cannot hear others in the call.

## Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="MemberCommandParams">
  Options for the deaf operation.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.memberId" type="string" default="Your own member">
  ID of the member to make deaf. If omitted, makes yourself deaf.
</APIField>

## Signature

```typescript
deaf(params?: MemberCommandParams): Promise<void>
```

## Permissions

- **Making yourself deaf:** Requires `call.capabilities.self.deaf.on`
- **Making another member deaf:** Requires `call.capabilities.member.deaf.on`

## Events

- [`member.updated`][event-member-updated] - General member update event
- [`member.updated.deaf`][event-member-updated-deaf] - Specific deaf state change
- [`member.updated.audioMuted`][event-member-updated-audiomuted] - Also emitted because microphone is auto-muted

## Important Notes

**Automatic Microphone Mute:** When you make a participant deaf, their microphone is automatically muted as well, even if you don't have the `muteAudio` permission.

```typescript
// Making deaf automatically mutes the microphone too
await call.deaf()

// You can manually unmute the microphone if needed
await call.audioUnmute()

// Now you can speak but still cannot hear others
```

This ensures that deaf participants don't accidentally broadcast audio when they can't hear the conversation.

**deaf() vs audioMute():**

| Method | Effect on You | Effect on Others |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| `deaf()` | You can't hear others (and your mic is muted) | Others can't hear you (mic auto-muted) |
| `audioMute()` | You can still hear others | Others can't hear you |

```typescript
// Scenario 1: You want to listen but not speak
await call.audioMute()  // You can hear, they can't hear you

// Scenario 2: You want to completely disconnect from audio
await call.deaf()  // You can't hear, they can't hear you (mic auto-muted)
```

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Make yourself deaf (mutes incoming audio)
await call.deaf()

// Or make another participant deaf
await call.deaf({ memberId: 'member-uuid' })
```
