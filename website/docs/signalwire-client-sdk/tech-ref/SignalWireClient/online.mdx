import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Brings the client online to receive incoming calls and messages. This method registers callback handlers for incoming call events.

## How it works

The `online` method establishes the client's availability on the SignalWire network. Once online, the client can receive incoming calls and other real-time events through the provided callback handlers.

### Callback handlers

You must provide handlers for incoming calls. These callbacks are invoked when events occur, allowing you to manage incoming calls appropriately.

## Parameters

<APIField name="incomingCallHandlers" type="OnlineParams" required>
  Configuration object containing callback handlers for incoming call events.
</APIField>

<APIField name="incomingCallHandlers.onCallReceived" type="(call: CallSession) => void" required>
  Called when an incoming call is received. Provides a CallSession object for the incoming call.
</APIField>

<APIField name="incomingCallHandlers.onCallEnded" type="(call: CallSession) => void">
  Called when an incoming call ends before being answered.
</APIField>

## Signature

```typescript
online(incomingCallHandlers: OnlineParams): Promise<void>
```

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

Returns a Promise that resolves when the client is successfully online.

## Examples

### Basic online setup

```typescript
await client.online({
  incomingCallHandlers: {
    onCallReceived: (call) => {
      console.log('Incoming call from:', call.from)
      call.answer()
    }
  }
})

console.log('Client is now online')
```
