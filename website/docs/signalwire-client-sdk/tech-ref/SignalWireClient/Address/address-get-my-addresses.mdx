import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Retrieves addresses associated with the current subscriber. This returns only the addresses that the authenticated user has access to.

## How it works

The `address.getMyAddresses` method queries the SignalWire platform for addresses specifically assigned to or accessible by the current subscriber. This is different from `getAddresses()` which returns all addresses in the space.

## Key concepts

### Subscriber-specific addresses

The response includes only addresses that:
- Are assigned to the current subscriber
- The subscriber has permissions to use
- Are configured for the subscriber's role

### Use cases

Retrieve subscriber addresses for:
- Displaying user-specific caller IDs
- Personal phone number selection
- User address management
- Permission-aware UI

## Parameters

None

## Signature

```typescript
address.getMyAddresses(): Promise<GetMyAddressesResult>
```

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<GetMyAddressesResult>`

Returns a Promise that resolves with a list of addresses available to the current subscriber.

## Examples

### Get my addresses

```typescript
const result = await client.address.getMyAddresses()

console.log('My addresses:', result.addresses)
```

### Display user's phone numbers

```typescript
const result = await client.address.getMyAddresses()

const select = document.getElementById('my-numbers-select')

result.addresses.forEach(address => {
  const option = document.createElement('option')
  option.value = address.number
  option.textContent = `${address.name} (${address.number})`
  select.appendChild(option)
})
```

### Get primary address

```typescript
const result = await client.address.getMyAddresses()

const primaryAddress = result.addresses.find(
  addr => addr.isPrimary
) || result.addresses[0]

console.log('Primary address:', primaryAddress.number)
```

### List my addresses with details

```typescript
const result = await client.address.getMyAddresses()

console.log('Your available addresses:')
result.addresses.forEach((address, index) => {
  console.log(`${index + 1}. ${address.number}`)
  console.log(`   Name: ${address.name}`)
  console.log(`   Type: ${address.type}`)
})
```

### Error handling

```typescript
try {
  const result = await client.address.getMyAddresses()
  console.log(`You have ${result.addresses.length} addresses`)
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to get your addresses:', error)
}
```

### Check if user has addresses

```typescript
const result = await client.address.getMyAddresses()

if (result.addresses.length === 0) {
  console.log('You do not have any addresses configured')
} else {
  console.log(`You have ${result.addresses.length} address(es)`)
}
```

### Filter my phone numbers

```typescript
const result = await client.address.getMyAddresses()

const phoneNumbers = result.addresses.filter(
  addr => addr.type === 'phone_number'
)

console.log('My phone numbers:', phoneNumbers.map(a => a.number))
```

### Use my address for outbound call

```typescript
const result = await client.address.getMyAddresses()

if (result.addresses.length > 0) {
  const myNumber = result.addresses[0].number
  
  const callSession = await client.dial({
    to: '+15551234567',
    from: myNumber
  })
  
  console.log('Calling from my number:', myNumber)
} else {
  console.error('No addresses available')
}
```

### Compare my addresses with all addresses

```typescript
const myAddresses = await client.address.getMyAddresses()
const allAddresses = await client.address.getAddresses()

console.log(`I have access to ${myAddresses.addresses.length} addresses`)
console.log(`Total addresses in space: ${allAddresses.addresses.length}`)
```

### Select preferred address

```typescript
async function selectPreferredAddress() {
  const result = await client.address.getMyAddresses()
  
  const preferred = localStorage.getItem('preferredAddress')
  
  const address = result.addresses.find(
    addr => addr.id === preferred
  ) || result.addresses[0]
  
  return address
}

const address = await selectPreferredAddress()
console.log('Using address:', address.number)
```
