import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Retrieves only the addresses that the current subscriber can be called with.
This is different from `getAddresses()` which returns all addresses visible to the subscriber.

## Parameters

None

## Signature

```typescript
address.getMyAddresses(): Promise<Address[]>
```

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<Address[]>`

Returns a Promise that resolves with an array of addresses that the current subscriber can be called with.

## Examples

### Get my addresses

```typescript
const addresses = await client.address.getMyAddresses()

console.log('My addresses:', addresses)
```

### Display user's addresses

```typescript
const addresses = await client.address.getMyAddresses()

const select = document.getElementById('my-addresses-select')

addresses.forEach(address => {
  const option = document.createElement('option')
  option.value = address.id
  option.textContent = `${address.display_name} (${address.name})`
  select.appendChild(option)
})
```
