import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Subscribes to real-time conversation events, allowing you to receive notifications for new messages, participant changes, and other conversation updates.

## How it works

The `conversation.subscribe` method establishes a real-time subscription to conversation events. When events occur (new messages, participants joining/leaving, etc.), your callback function is invoked with event details.

## Parameters

<APIField name="callback" type="ConversationSubscribeCallback" required>
  Callback function invoked when conversation events occur.
</APIField>

## Signature

```typescript
conversation.subscribe(callback: ConversationSubscribeCallback): Promise<ConversationSubscribeResult>
```

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<ConversationSubscribeResult>`

Returns a Promise that resolves with subscription details including an unsubscribe method.

## Examples

### Subscribe to conversation events

```typescript
const subscription = await client.conversation.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log('Conversation event:', event.type)
  
  if (event.type === 'message.created') {
    console.log('New message:', event.message.content)
  }
})
```
