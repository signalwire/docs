Joins a persistent conversation, allowing you to send and receive messages in that conversation.

## How it works

The `conversation.join` method adds you as a participant to a persistent conversation. Once joined, you can send messages, receive updates, and access the conversation history.

## Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="JoinConversationParams" required>
  Configuration for joining the conversation.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.conversationId" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the conversation to join.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.memberId" type="string">
  Optional member identifier for the participant.
</APIField>

## Signature

```typescript
conversation.join(params: JoinConversationParams): Promise<JoinConversationResponse>
```

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<JoinConversationResponse>`

Returns a Promise that resolves with conversation details and participant information.

## Examples

### Join a conversation

```typescript
const response = await client.conversation.join({
  conversationId: 'conversation-id-here'
})

console.log('Joined conversation:', response.conversationId)
```
