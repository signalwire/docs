The `disconnect` method gracefully terminates the client connection to SignalWire, including all
active calls, and event subscriptions. 

After disconnecting, you need to create a new client instance or call connection methods again to reconnect.

## Parameters

None

## Signature

```typescript
disconnect(): Promise<void>
```

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

Returns a Promise that resolves when the disconnection is complete.

## Examples

### Basic disconnect

```typescript
await client.disconnect()
console.log('Disconnected from SignalWire')
```
