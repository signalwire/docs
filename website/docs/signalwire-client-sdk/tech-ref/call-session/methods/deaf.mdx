import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Mutes incoming audio so you or another participant cannot hear others in the call.

## Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="MemberCommandParams">
  Options for the deaf operation.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.memberId" type="string" default="Your own member">
  ID of the member to make deaf. If omitted, makes yourself deaf.
</APIField>

## Signature

```typescript
deaf(params?: MemberCommandParams): Promise<void>
```

## Permissions

- **Making yourself deaf:** Requires `call.capabilities.self.deaf.on`
- **Making another member deaf:** Requires `call.capabilities.member.deaf.on`

## Events

- `member.updated` - General member update event
- `member.updated.deaf` - Specific deaf state change
- `member.updated.audioMuted` - Also emitted because microphone is auto-muted

## Important Notes

**Automatic Microphone Mute:** When you make a participant deaf, their microphone is automatically muted as well, even if you don't have the `muteAudio` permission.

```typescript
// Making deaf automatically mutes the microphone too
await call.deaf()

// You can manually unmute the microphone if needed
await call.audioUnmute()

// Now you can speak but still cannot hear others
```

This ensures that deaf participants don't accidentally broadcast audio when they can't hear the conversation.

**deaf() vs audioMute():**

| Method | Effect on You | Effect on Others |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| `deaf()` | You can't hear others (and your mic is muted) | Others can't hear you (mic auto-muted) |
| `audioMute()` | You can still hear others | Others can't hear you |

```typescript
// Scenario 1: You want to listen but not speak
await call.audioMute()  // You can hear, they can't hear you

// Scenario 2: You want to completely disconnect from audio
await call.deaf()  // You can't hear, they can't hear you (mic auto-muted)
```

## Examples

### Make yourself deaf

```typescript
await call.deaf()
console.log('You can no longer hear other participants')
```

### Make another participant deaf

```typescript
const { members } = await call.getMembers()
const member = members.find(m => m.name === 'John Doe')

if (member) {
  await call.deaf({ memberId: member.id })
}
```

### Check capabilities before making deaf

```typescript
if (call.capabilities?.self.deaf.on) {
  await call.deaf()
}
```

### Listen for deaf state changes

```typescript
call.on('member.updated.deaf', (event) => {
  const status = event.member.deaf ? 'deaf' : 'can hear'
  console.log(`Member ${event.member.id} is now ${status}`)
})

await call.deaf()
```
