import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Ends the call for yourself or another participant, disconnecting them completely.

## Signature

```typescript
end(params?: MemberCommandParams): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="MemberCommandParams">
  Configuration object.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.memberId" type="string" default="Your member ID">
  Member to end the call for. Omit to end your own call, provide specific ID to end another member's call.
</APIField>

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Important Notes

**end() vs hangup() vs leave():**

| Method | Effect | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `end()` | Ends call for yourself or another member | General disconnect, can target specific members |
| `hangup()` | Ends your own call | Explicitly disconnect yourself |
| `leave()` | Alias for `hangup()` | Same as hangup, more semantic name |

**When to use each:**

```typescript
// End your own call
await call.end()        // ✅ Works
await call.hangup()     // ✅ Works (more explicit)
await call.leave()      // ✅ Works (semantic alias)

// End another member's call
await call.end({ memberId: 'member-123' })  // ✅ Works
await call.removeMember({ memberId: 'member-123' })  // ✅ Alternative method
```

**end() vs removeMember():**

Both methods can disconnect a participant:

| Method | Purpose | Semantic Meaning |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `end()` | End the call for a member | Terminate their call session |
| `removeMember()` | Remove a member from the call | Kick them out / moderate |

**Recommendation:** Use `removeMember()` for moderation actions (kicking users), and `end()` for general disconnection.

**Cleanup Behavior:** When you end your own call:
- WebRTC connection is closed
- All media streams are stopped
- Screen shares are automatically stopped
- Event listeners remain active (clean them up manually if needed)

## Events

When a call is ended, the following events may fire:
- `call.left` - Participant has left the call
- `member.left` - Member has been removed from the call

```typescript
call.on('member.left', (event) => {
  console.log(`Member ${event.member.id} left the call`)
})
```

## Examples

### End your own call

```typescript
await call.end()
console.log('You have left the call')
```

### End another participant's call

```typescript
await call.end({ memberId: 'member-123' })
console.log('Member removed from call')
```

### Get member ID and end their call

```typescript
const { members } = await call.getMembers()
const memberToRemove = members.find(m => m.name === 'John Doe')

if (memberToRemove) {
  await call.end({ memberId: memberToRemove.id })
  console.log(`${memberToRemove.name} has been removed from the call`)
}
```

### Graceful disconnect

```typescript
async function leaveCallGracefully() {
  // Mute audio/video before leaving
  await call.audioMute()
  await call.videoMute()

  // End the call
  await call.end()

  console.log('Left call gracefully')
}
```

### End call with confirmation

```typescript
async function endCallWithConfirmation() {
  const confirmed = confirm('Are you sure you want to end the call?')

  if (confirmed) {
    try {
      await call.end()
      console.log('Call ended by user')
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to end call:', error)
    }
  }
}
```
