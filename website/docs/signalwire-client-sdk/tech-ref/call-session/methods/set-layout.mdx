[event-layout-changed]: /sdks/signalwire-client-sdk/call-session/events#layoutchanged

Changes the video layout for the call, optionally positioning specific members.

## Signature

```typescript
setLayout(params: SetLayoutParams): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="SetLayoutParams" required>
  Layout configuration object.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.name" type="string" required>
  Name of the layout to apply (e.g., "grid-responsive", "2x2", "6x6").
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.positions" type="Record<string, [VideoPosition](/sdks/signalwire-client-sdk/types#videoposition)>">
  Map of member IDs to specific positions in the layout.
</APIField>

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Important Notes

**Layout Availability:**
- Available layouts depend on your SignalWire project configuration
- Use `getLayouts()` to retrieve the list of available layouts
- Common layouts: `grid-responsive`, `2x2`, `3x3`, `4x4`, `5x5`, `6x6`, `8x8`

**Position Types:**

**Reserved Positions** (`reserved-1`, `reserved-2`, etc.)
- Pin important participants to specific spots
- Remain fixed even as other members join/leave

**Standard Positions** (`standard-1`, `standard-2`, etc.)
- Dynamic positioning for regular participants

**Special Positions:**
- `auto` - SDK automatically positions the member
- `off-canvas` - Member is in the call but not visible
- `full-screen` - Member takes up the entire screen
- `playback` - For media playback positioning

**Positions vs setPositions():**
- `setLayout()` can optionally set positions while changing the layout
- Use `setPositions()` if you only want to reposition members without changing the layout

## Events

- [`layout.changed`][event-layout-changed] - Layout has been updated

```typescript
call.on('layout.changed', (event) => {
  console.log('New layout:', event.layout.name)
})
```

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Set a basic layout
await call.setLayout({ name: '6x6' })

// Set layout with member positions
await call.setLayout({
  name: '6x6',
  positions: {
    'member-id-1': 'reserved-1',
    'self': 'reserved-2'
  }
})
```
