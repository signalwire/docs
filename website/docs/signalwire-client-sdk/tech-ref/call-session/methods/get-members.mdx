## Important Notes

**Real-time Updates:** `getMembers()` returns a snapshot of members at the time it's called. For real-time updates, listen to member events:

```typescript
call.on('member.joined', (event) => {
  console.log('Member joined:', event.member.name)
})

call.on('member.left', (event) => {
  console.log('Member left:', event.member.id)
})

call.on('member.updated', (event) => {
  console.log('Member updated:', event.member.name)
})
```

**Getting Your Own Member:** Your own member is included in the members array:

```typescript
const { members } = await call.getMembers()
const me = members.find(m => m.id === call.memberId)

if (me) {
  console.log('My name:', me.name)
  console.log('Am I muted?', me.audioMuted)
}
```

## Events

Several events involve member information:
- `member.joined` - New member joined the call
- `member.left` - Member left the call
- `member.updated` - Member state changed
- `member.updated.audioMuted` - Audio mute state changed
- `member.updated.videoMuted` - Video mute state changed
- `member.talking` - Member started or stopped talking
- `memberList.updated` - Batch update of multiple members

## Examples

### Get all members

```typescript
const { members } = await call.getMembers()
console.log(`There are ${members.length} participants in the call`)

members.forEach(member => {
  console.log(`Member: ${member.name} (ID: ${member.id})`)
})
```

### Find a specific member

```typescript
const { members} = await call.getMembers()

const john = members.find(m => m.name === 'John Doe')

if (john) {
  console.log('John is in the call')
  console.log('Audio muted:', john.audioMuted)
  console.log('Video muted:', john.videoMuted)
}
```

### Control another member

```typescript
const { members } = await call.getMembers()
const targetMember = members.find(m => m.name === 'Jane Smith')

if (targetMember) {
  await call.audioMute({ memberId: targetMember.id })
  console.log(`Muted ${targetMember.name}`)
}
```

### Filter members by state

```typescript
const { members } = await call.getMembers()

// Find who's talking
const talking = members.filter(m => m.talking)
console.log('Currently talking:', talking.map(m => m.name))

// Find who has video muted
const videoMuted = members.filter(m => m.videoMuted)
console.log('Video muted:', videoMuted.map(m => m.name))

// Find who has hand raised
const handsRaised = members.filter(m => m.handraised)
console.log('Hands raised:', handsRaised.map(m => m.name))
```

### Track member count

```typescript
async function updateMemberCount() {
  const { members } = await call.getMembers()
  const count = members.length

  document.getElementById('member-count').textContent = `${count} participant${count !== 1 ? 's' : ''}`
}

// Update on member changes
call.on('member.joined', updateMemberCount)
call.on('member.left', updateMemberCount)

// Initial update
updateMemberCount()
```
