import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Adjusts the microphone sensitivity threshold for detecting when a participant is speaking.

## Signature

```typescript
setInputSensitivity(params: MemberCommandWithValueParams): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="MemberCommandWithValueParams" required>
  Sensitivity configuration object.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.value" type="number" required>
  Sensitivity level from 0 to 100. Default is 30.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.memberId" type="string" default="Your member ID">
  Member to control. Omit to control your own microphone, provide specific ID to control another member.
</APIField>

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Important Notes

**Sensitivity Scale (0 to 100):**

| Value | Behavior | Use Case |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `0` | Lowest sensitivity (essentially muted) | Completely suppress voice detection |
| `1-20` | Very low sensitivity | Very noisy environments, only detect loud speech |
| `21-40` | Low to moderate sensitivity | Noisy environments, normal speech levels |
| `30` | **Default** | Balanced for most environments |
| `41-60` | Moderate to high sensitivity | Quiet environments |
| `61-80` | High sensitivity | Very quiet environments, soft-spoken users |
| `81-100` | Very high sensitivity | Detect very quiet speech, may pick up noise |

**Sensitivity vs Volume:**

| Setting | Controls | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Input Sensitivity** | Speech detection threshold | When the `member.talking` event fires |
| **Input Volume** | Audio loudness | How loud the microphone sounds to others |

```typescript
// High sensitivity = detect quieter speech (lower threshold for talking detection)
await call.setInputSensitivity({ value: 80 })

// High volume = louder microphone output (others hear you louder)
await call.setInputVolume({ volume: 10 })
```

**Effect on member.talking Event:**
- Sensitivity controls when the `member.talking` event is triggered
- **Higher sensitivity** = Quieter speech triggers the event
- **Lower sensitivity** = Only louder speech triggers the event
- Does NOT affect the actual audio transmitted to other participants

```typescript
// With high sensitivity (80), even whispers may trigger talking event
await call.setInputSensitivity({ value: 80 })

call.on('member.talking', (event) => {
  console.log(`Member ${event.member.id} is talking:`, event.member.talking)
})
```

**Environment Considerations:**

**Noisy Environments:**
- Use **lower sensitivity** (10-20) to avoid false positives
- Prevents background noise from triggering talking detection
- User must speak louder to be detected as talking

**Quiet Environments:**
- Use **higher sensitivity** (60-80) to detect softer speech
- Allows natural conversation without raising voice
- May pick up background sounds as false positives

**Real-time Adjustment:**
- Sensitivity changes take effect immediately
- No need to restart microphone or re-join call
- Can be adjusted dynamically based on detected noise levels

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Increase sensitivity (detect quieter speech)
await call.setInputSensitivity({ value: 80 })

// Reset to default sensitivity
await call.setInputSensitivity({ value: 30 })

// Decrease sensitivity (only detect louder speech)
await call.setInputSensitivity({ value: 15 })
```
