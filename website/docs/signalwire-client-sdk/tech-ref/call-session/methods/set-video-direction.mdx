import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Sets the direction of the video track in the WebRTC connection by performing RTC peer renegotiation.

## Parameters

<APIField name="direction" type="UpdateMediaDirection" required>
  The desired video direction. Valid values: `'sendrecv'`, `'sendonly'`, `'recvonly'`, `'inactive'`
</APIField>

**UpdateMediaDirection** values:
- `'sendrecv'` - Send and receive video (default, two-way video)
- `'sendonly'` - Only send video, don't receive
- `'recvonly'` - Only receive video, don't send
- `'inactive'` - Neither send nor receive video

## Signature

```typescript
call.setVideoDirection(direction: UpdateMediaDirection): Promise<void>
```

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Examples

### Enable Two-Way Video

```typescript
await call.setVideoDirection('sendrecv')
```

### Watch-Only Mode

```typescript
// Receive video but don't send
await call.setVideoDirection('recvonly')
```

### Broadcast Mode

```typescript
// Send video but don't receive
await call.setVideoDirection('sendonly')
```

### Disable Video Completely

```typescript
// Neither send nor receive video
await call.setVideoDirection('inactive')
```

### Upgrade Audio-Only Call to Video

```typescript
// Start with audio only (video inactive)
await call.setVideoDirection('inactive')

// Later, enable two-way video
await call.setVideoDirection('sendrecv')
```

### Large Conference (Bandwidth Savings)

```typescript
// In a 50-person call, only send your video
// Don't receive 49 other video streams
await call.setVideoDirection('sendonly')
```

## Important Notes

**Peer Renegotiation:** This method triggers WebRTC peer renegotiation to update the video track direction. The connection will temporarily adjust while renegotiating.

**Direction vs Mute:**
- **Mute** (`videoMute()`): Temporarily stops sending video, but the track remains active
- **Direction**: Changes the fundamental video flow in the WebRTC connection

Use `setVideoDirection()` when you need to:
- Permanently disable video sending or receiving
- Optimize bandwidth by not receiving video when unnecessary
- Upgrade from audio-only to video call
- Implement broadcast or watch-only modes

Use `videoMute()`/`videoUnmute()` when you just need to temporarily stop sending video.

**Audio Unaffected:** This method only changes the video direction. Audio direction remains unchanged. To update both, use `updateMedia()`.
