Leaves the call and disconnects from the WebRTC session. This is an alias for `hangup()`.

## Signature

```typescript
leave(): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Important Notes

**Alias for hangup():**

`leave()` is functionally identical to `hangup()`. Both methods:
- End the call for the local participant
- Disconnect the WebRTC connection
- Clean up all resources
- Trigger the `destroy` event

```typescript
// These are equivalent
await call.leave()
await call.hangup()
```

**Cleanup:**

Always listen to the `destroy` event to know when cleanup is complete:

```typescript
call.on('destroy', () => {
  console.log('Call resources cleaned up')
  // Perform any additional cleanup
})

await call.leave()
```

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Leave the call
await call.leave()
```
