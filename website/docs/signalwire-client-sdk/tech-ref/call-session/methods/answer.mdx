slug: /call-session/answer
---

Answers an incoming call and establishes the WebRTC connection.

## Signature

```typescript
answer(): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Important Notes

**Use invite.accept() Instead:** For incoming calls in the Call/Unified API, use the `invite.accept()` method provided in the call notification rather than calling `answer()` directly.

**Correct approach:**
```typescript
client.on('call.received', (notification) => {
  const call = notification.invite.accept({ audio: true, video: true })
})
```

**Not typically used:**
```typescript
// Direct answer() calls are handled internally by the SDK
await call.answer()
```

**Lifecycle Events:** When answering a call, listen for these events:
- `call.joined` - Call successfully answered and joined
- `room.subscribed` - Subscribed to call room events
- `destroy` - Call failed to answer or was terminated

**Inbound Call Direction:** The `answer()` method is only relevant for inbound calls (calls you receive). For outbound calls initiated with `client.dial()`, use `start()` instead.

## Events

When answering a call, the following events are emitted:
- `call.joined` - Successfully joined the call
- `room.subscribed` - Subscribed to call events
- Connection state events: `connecting`, `connected`, etc.
- `destroy` - Call failed or ended

## Examples

### Standard Pattern (Recommended)

Use `invite.accept()` when handling incoming calls:

```typescript
// Set up incoming call handler
client.on('call.received', (notification) => {
  console.log('Incoming call from:', notification.invite.details.caller_id_name)

  // Accept the incoming call - this internally handles the answer process
  const call = notification.invite.accept({
    audio: true,
    video: true
  })

  // Call is now answered and connecting
  call.on('call.joined', () => {
    console.log('Call answered and joined successfully')
  })
})
```

### With Call Parameters

```typescript
client.on('call.received', (notification) => {
  const call = notification.invite.accept({
    audio: true,
    video: false,  // Audio-only call
    rootElement: document.getElementById('video-container')
  })

  call.on('call.joined', () => {
    console.log('Audio call answered')
  })
})
```

### Rejecting Instead of Answering

```typescript
client.on('call.received', (notification) => {
  const callerName = notification.invite.details.caller_id_name

  // Reject the call
  await notification.invite.reject()
  console.log(`Rejected call from ${callerName}`)
})
```

### Error Handling

```typescript
client.on('call.received', (notification) => {
  try {
    const call = notification.invite.accept({ audio: true, video: true })

    call.on('call.joined', () => {
      console.log('Call answered successfully')
    })

    call.on('destroy', () => {
      console.error('Call failed to connect')
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to accept call:', error)
  }
})
```
