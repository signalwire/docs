Answers an incoming call and establishes the WebRTC connection.

## Signature

```typescript
answer(): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Important Notes

**Use invite.accept() Instead:** For incoming calls in the Call/Unified API, use the `invite.accept()` method provided in the call notification rather than calling `answer()` directly.

**Correct approach:**
```typescript
client.on('call.received', (notification) => {
  const call = notification.invite.accept({ audio: true, video: true })
})
```

**Not typically used:**
```typescript
// Direct answer() calls are handled internally by the SDK
await call.answer()
```

**Inbound Call Direction:** The `answer()` method is only relevant for inbound calls (calls you receive). For outbound calls initiated with `client.dial()`, use `start()` instead.

## Events

When answering a call, the following events are emitted:
- [`call.joined`][event-call-joined] - Successfully joined the call
- [`room.subscribed`][event-room-subscribed] - Subscribed to call events
- Connection state events: `connecting`, `connected`, etc.
- `destroy` - Call failed or ended

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and handle incoming calls
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })

// Answer incoming call using invite.accept() (recommended)
client.on('call.received', (notification) => {
  const call = notification.invite.accept({
    audio: true,
    video: true
  })
})
```
