import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Unmutes incoming audio so you or another participant can hear others in the call again.

## Signature

```typescript
undeaf(params?: MemberCommandParams): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="MemberCommandParams">
  Configuration for the undeaf operation.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.memberId" type="string" default="Your member ID">
  Member to undeaf. Omit to undeaf yourself, provide specific ID to undeaf another member.
</APIField>

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Permissions

- **Undeaf yourself:** Requires `call.capabilities.self.deaf.off`
- **Undeaf another member:** Requires `call.capabilities.member.deaf.off`

## Events

- `member.updated` - General member update event
- `member.updated.deaf` - Specific event for deaf state change

## Important Notes

**Microphone Remains Muted:**

When you call `undeaf()`, the microphone remains muted. You must manually call `audioUnmute()` to speak again.

```typescript
// Step 1: Resume hearing others
await call.undeaf()
console.log('You can hear others now')

// Step 2: Manually unmute microphone to speak
await call.audioUnmute()
console.log('You can now hear and speak')
```

This is intentional - it gives you control over when you want to start speaking again.

**Member Targeting:**

The `memberId` parameter follows the standard member targeting pattern:
- **No parameter** - Undeafs yourself
- **Specific member ID** - Undeafs that member (requires permission)

```typescript
// Undeaf yourself
await call.undeaf()

// Undeaf a specific member
await call.undeaf({ memberId: 'de550c0c-3fac-4efd-b06f-b5b8614b8966' })
```

**Resume Participation Workflow:**

```typescript
async function resumeFullParticipation() {
  try {
    // Step 1: Resume hearing
    await call.undeaf()
    console.log('Can hear others')

    // Step 2: Resume speaking
    await call.audioUnmute()
    console.log('Can speak')

    console.log('Fully rejoined the conversation')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to resume participation:', error)
  }
}

resumeFullParticipation()
```

## Examples

### Undeaf yourself

```typescript
// Resume hearing other participants
await call.undeaf()
console.log('You can now hear other participants again')
```

### Undeaf another participant

```typescript
// Get the list of members
const { members } = await call.getMembers()

// Find a specific member
const member = members.find(m => m.name === 'John Doe')

if (member) {
  // Undeaf that member (requires permission)
  await call.undeaf({ memberId: member.id })
  console.log(`${member.name} can now hear other participants`)
}
```

### Resume full participation after being deaf

```typescript
// You were made deaf, now resume full participation
await call.undeaf()  // Resume hearing others

// Microphone is still muted from when you were made deaf
await call.audioUnmute()  // Resume speaking

console.log('You can now hear and speak in the call')
```

### With event listeners

```typescript
// Listen for undeaf events
call.on('member.updated.deaf', (event) => {
  if (!event.member.deaf) {
    console.log(`Member ${event.member.id} can now hear others`)
  }
})

// Undeaf yourself
await call.undeaf()
```

### Check capabilities before undeafing

```typescript
// Check if you can undeaf yourself
if (call.capabilities?.self.deaf.off) {
  await call.undeaf()
  console.log('Successfully undeaf yourself')
} else {
  console.log('You do not have permission to undeaf yourself')
}

// Check if you can undeaf other members
if (call.capabilities?.member.deaf.off) {
  await call.undeaf({ memberId: 'member-id' })
  console.log('Successfully undeaf member')
} else {
  console.log('You do not have permission to undeaf other members')
}
```
