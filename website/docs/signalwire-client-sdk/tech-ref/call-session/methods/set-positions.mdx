import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Repositions multiple members within the current video layout without changing the layout itself.

## Signature

```typescript
setPositions(params: SetPositionsParams): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="SetPositionsParams" required>
  Positioning configuration object.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.positions" type="Record<string, [VideoPosition](/sdks/signalwire-sdk/types#videoposition)>" required>
  Map of member IDs to their desired positions in the layout.
</APIField>

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Important Notes

**setPositions() vs setLayout():**

| Method | Purpose | Layout Change |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `setLayout()` | Change layout **and** optionally position members | ✅ Changes layout |
| `setPositions()` | Reposition members **within** current layout | ❌ Keeps current layout |

**When to use each:**

```typescript
// Change from 2x2 to 6x6 layout AND position members
await call.setLayout({
  name: '6x6',
  positions: {
    'member-1': 'reserved-1'
  }
})

// Keep current layout (6x6), just move members around
await call.setPositions({
  positions: {
    'member-1': 'reserved-2',
    'member-2': 'reserved-1'
  }
})
```

**Position Types:**

**Reserved Positions** (`reserved-1`, `reserved-2`, etc.)
- Pin important participants to specific spots
- Remain fixed even as other members join/leave

**Standard Positions** (`standard-1`, `standard-2`, etc.)
- Dynamic positioning for regular participants

**Special Positions:**
- `auto` - SDK automatically positions the member
- `off-canvas` - Member is in the call but not visible
- `full-screen` - Member takes up the entire screen
- `playback` - For media playback positioning

**Using "self" Keyword:**
- Use `"self"` as a key when you don't know your own member ID yet
- Useful when joining a call and positioning yourself immediately
- Can be mixed with explicit member IDs

**Persistence:**
- Position settings persist until explicitly changed
- New members joining will not automatically take reserved positions
- Positions remain even if members temporarily leave and rejoin

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Reposition multiple members
await call.setPositions({
  positions: {
    'member-id-1': 'reserved-1',
    'member-id-2': 'reserved-2',
    'self': 'auto'
  }
})
```
