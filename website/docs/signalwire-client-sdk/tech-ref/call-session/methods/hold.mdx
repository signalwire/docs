Puts the call on hold by stopping outbound audio and video from the local participant.

## Signature

```typescript
call.hold(): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Put the call on hold
await call.hold()
```

## Important Notes

**What Happens on Hold:**
- Your outbound audio and video streams are stopped
- You continue to receive audio and video from other participants
- The WebRTC connection remains active
- Other participants will see/hear that you're on hold (muted)

**Hold vs Mute:**
- **Hold**: Stops both audio AND video outbound streams
- **Mute**: Stops only audio (`audioMute()`) or only video (`videoMute()`)

Use `hold()` when you want to completely pause your participation in the call but stay connected.

**Still Connected:** While on hold, you remain connected to the call:
- You can still receive audio/video from others
- You can still listen to the conversation
- Other participants remain in the call
- You can use `unhold()` to resume

**Not a Pause:** Hold does not pause the call for other participants. They continue their conversation - you just stop sending audio/video to them.
