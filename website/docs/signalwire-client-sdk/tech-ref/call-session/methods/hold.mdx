title: hold
slug: /call-session/hold
---

Puts the call on hold by stopping outbound audio and video from the local participant.

## Signature

```typescript
call.hold(): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Examples

### Basic Hold

```typescript
await call.hold()
console.log('Call is now on hold')
```

### Hold/Unhold Toggle

```typescript
let isOnHold = false

async function toggleHold() {
  if (isOnHold) {
    await call.unhold()
    console.log('Call resumed')
  } else {
    await call.hold()
    console.log('Call on hold')
  }
  isOnHold = !isOnHold
}

await toggleHold()
```

### Hold with UI Feedback

```typescript
const holdButton = document.getElementById('hold-button')

holdButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  try {
    await call.hold()
    holdButton.textContent = 'Resume'
    holdButton.classList.add('on-hold')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to hold call:', error)
  }
})
```

### Multi-Call Management

```typescript
class CallManager {
  constructor() {
    this.calls = []
  }

  async switchToCall(targetCall) {
    // Hold all other calls
    for (const call of this.calls) {
      if (call !== targetCall) {
        await call.hold()
      }
    }

    // Unhold the target call
    await targetCall.unhold()
  }
}
```

## Important Notes

**What Happens on Hold:**
- Your outbound audio and video streams are stopped
- You continue to receive audio and video from other participants
- The WebRTC connection remains active
- Other participants will see/hear that you're on hold (muted)

**Hold vs Mute:**
- **Hold**: Stops both audio AND video outbound streams
- **Mute**: Stops only audio (`audioMute()`) or only video (`videoMute()`)

Use `hold()` when you want to completely pause your participation in the call but stay connected.

**Still Connected:** While on hold, you remain connected to the call:
- You can still receive audio/video from others
- You can still listen to the conversation
- Other participants remain in the call
- You can use `unhold()` to resume

**Not a Pause:** Hold does not pause the call for other participants. They continue their conversation - you just stop sending audio/video to them.
