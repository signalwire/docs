import APIField from '@site/src/components/APIField';

Returns the member overlay element on top of the root element for a specific member.

## Signature

```typescript
getMemberOverlay(memberId: string): UserOverlay | undefined
```

## Parameters

<APIField name="memberId" type="string" required>
  The ID of the member whose overlay to retrieve.
</APIField>

## Returns

**Type:** `UserOverlay | undefined`

Returns the overlay object for the specified member, or `undefined` if not found.

## Important Notes

**Root Element Required:**

Member overlays are only available when a `rootElement` is provided during call setup:

```typescript
const call = await client.dial({
  to: 'user@example.com',
  rootElement: document.getElementById('video-container')
})

// Now overlays are available
const overlay = call.getMemberOverlay(memberId)
```

**Overlay Availability:**

Overlays are created when members join and have active video. If a member doesn't have an overlay, `getMemberOverlay()` returns `undefined`.

**Use Cases:**

- Custom UI elements on top of member video
- Adding badges or indicators to member tiles
- Implementing custom controls per member
- Accessing DOM elements for advanced manipulation

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call with rootElement
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({
  to: '/public/example',
  rootElement: document.getElementById('video-container')
})

// Get member overlay
const overlay = call.getMemberOverlay('member-uuid')
if (overlay) {
  console.log('Found overlay for member')
}
```
