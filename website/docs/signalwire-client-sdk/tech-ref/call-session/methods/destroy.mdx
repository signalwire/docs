Destroys the CallSession JavaScript object and cleans up local resources. This does not affect the server-side call or other participants.

## Signature

```typescript
call.destroy(): void
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `void`

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// End the call
await call.hangup()

// Clean up the local object
call.destroy()
```

## Important Notes

**Local Only**: This method only destroys the JavaScript object locally. It does not:
- End the call on the server
- Remove you from the call
- Affect other participants
- Stop WebRTC connections

To end the call properly, use `hangup()` before calling `destroy()`.

**Memory Cleanup**: Use this method to:
- Clean up event listeners
- Release local resources
- Prevent memory leaks in long-running applications
- Free up browser resources

**Object Unusable After Destroy**: Once `destroy()` is called, the CallSession object cannot be used anymore. Any subsequent method calls will likely fail.

**Automatic Cleanup**: In most cases, you don't need to manually call `destroy()`. The SDK automatically cleans up when:
- The call ends via `hangup()`
- The page unloads
- The component unmounts (in framework integrations)

Only call `destroy()` manually when you need explicit control over resource cleanup.
