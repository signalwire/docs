---

Unlocks the call to allow new participants to join.

## Signature

```typescript
unlock(): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Important Notes

**Permissions:**

Permission requirements vary based on your call configuration.
- May require `room.unlock` capability

**Unlock Behavior:**

When a call is unlocked:
- New participants **can** join the call
- Participants who previously left can rejoin
- The unlock state persists until explicitly locked again

Unlock does NOT affect:
- Existing participants (they remain in the call)
- Screen sharing or other call features
- Media streams or audio/video

**Checking Lock State:**

Track lock state manually:

```typescript
let isCallLocked = false

async function lockCall() {
  await call.lock()
  isCallLocked = true
}

async function unlockCall() {
  await call.unlock()
  isCallLocked = false
}

// Check state
if (!isCallLocked) {
  console.log('Call is unlocked - new participants can join')
}
```

## Events

Lock/unlock operations may trigger room update events:

```typescript
call.on('room.updated', (event) => {
  console.log('Room updated, locked state may have changed')
})
```

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Lock the call to prevent new participants
await call.lock()

// Unlock the call to allow new participants
await call.unlock()
```
