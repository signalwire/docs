title: start
slug: /call-session/start
---

Initiates the WebRTC connection and joins the call session.

## Signature

```typescript
start(): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

**Resolves:** When the call has successfully joined (after `room.subscribed` event fires)

**Rejects:** If the call fails to start or is destroyed before joining

## Important Notes

**Automatic Invocation:**

In most use cases, you don't need to call `start()` manually. The SDK automatically calls it when:
- You provide `listen` parameter to `client.dial()`
- You provide `listen` parameter to `client.reattach()`

**What it does:**
1. Initiates the WebRTC connection
2. Sends the appropriate signaling message (invite for outbound, answer for inbound)
3. Waits for the `room.subscribed` event confirming you've joined
4. Resolves when the call is successfully established

**Lifecycle Events:**

`start()` waits for specific events to complete:
- **Success:** Resolves when `room.subscribed` event fires
- **Failure:** Rejects if `destroy` event fires before joining

**Call Only Once:**

Do not call `start()` multiple times on the same `CallSession` object. It should only be invoked once per call session.

## Events

During the `start()` process, the following events may be emitted:

- `room.subscribed` - Fires when successfully joined (causes `start()` to resolve)
- `destroy` - Fires if the call fails to start (causes `start()` to reject)
- Connection state events: `connecting`, `connected`, etc.

## Examples

### Automatic usage (recommended)

When you provide event listeners to `dial()`, the SDK automatically calls `start()`:

```typescript
// The SDK calls start() automatically when you provide listeners
const call = await client.dial({
  to: 'user@example.com',
  listen: {
    onCallJoined: () => console.log('Call joined!')
  }
})

// Call is already started and joined at this point
console.log('Call is active:', call.memberId)
```

### Manual usage (advanced)

In advanced scenarios where you need explicit control:

```typescript
// Get the call session without starting it
const callSession = buildOutboundCall({ to: 'user@example.com' })

// Set up event listeners first
callSession.on('room.subscribed', () => {
  console.log('Successfully joined the call')
})

callSession.on('destroy', () => {
  console.log('Call failed to start')
})

// Now manually start the call
try {
  await callSession.start()
  console.log('Call started successfully')
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to start call:', error)
}
```

### With error handling

```typescript
try {
  await call.start()
  console.log('Call connected successfully')
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Call failed to start:', error.message)
  // Handle failure - call may have been destroyed
}
```

### Listening for lifecycle events

```typescript
call.on('room.subscribed', (params) => {
  console.log('Joined call:', params.call_id)
})

call.on('destroy', () => {
  console.log('Call was destroyed before joining')
})

await call.start()
```
