[event-room-subscribed]: /sdks/signalwire-sdk/call-session/events#roomsubscribed

Initiates the WebRTC connection and joins the call session.

## Signature

```typescript
start(): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

**Resolves:** When the call has successfully joined (after `room.subscribed` event fires)

**Rejects:** If the call fails to start or is destroyed before joining

## Important Notes

**Automatic Invocation:**

In most use cases, you don't need to call `start()` manually. The SDK automatically calls it when:
- You provide `listen` parameter to `client.dial()`
- You provide `listen` parameter to `client.reattach()`

**What it does:**
1. Initiates the WebRTC connection
2. Sends the appropriate signaling message (invite for outbound, answer for inbound)
3. Waits for the `room.subscribed` event confirming you've joined
4. Resolves when the call is successfully established

**Call Only Once:**

Do not call `start()` multiple times on the same `CallSession` object. It should only be invoked once per call session.

## Events

During the `start()` process, the following events may be emitted:

- [`room.subscribed`][event-room-subscribed] - Fires when successfully joined (causes `start()` to resolve)
- `destroy` - Fires if the call fails to start (causes `start()` to reject)
- Connection state events: `connecting`, `connected`, etc.

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// In most cases, start() is called automatically by dial()
// For manual control in advanced scenarios:
call.on('room.subscribed', () => {
  console.log('Successfully joined the call')
})

try {
  await call.start()
  console.log('Call started successfully')
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to start call:', error)
}
```
