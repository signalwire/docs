Locks the call to prevent new participants from joining.

## Signature

```typescript
lock(): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

None

## Returns

**Type:** `Promise<void>`

## Important Notes

**Lock Behavior:** When a call is locked:
- New participants **cannot** join the call
- Existing participants remain in the call
- Participants who left cannot rejoin until the call is unlocked
- The lock state persists until explicitly unlocked

**Lock does NOT affect:**
- Existing participants (they stay in the call)
- Ability to invite existing members back
- Screen sharing or other call features
- Media streams or audio/video

## Events

Lock/unlock operations may trigger room update events:

```typescript
call.on('room.updated', (event) => {
  console.log('Room updated, locked state may have changed')
})
```

## Example

```typescript
// Initialize client and start a call
const client = await SignalWire({ token: '<your-token>' })
const call = await client.dial({ to: '/public/example' })

// Lock the call to prevent new participants from joining
await call.lock()
```
