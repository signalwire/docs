# Notifications

If you've initialized the SignalWire Client with a subscriber token, you can opt into receiving notifications 
whenever that subscriber address is called using WebSockets.

The WebSocket notifications are delivered over the WebSocket connection while your application is active, and you have
called the [`online()`](/sdks/signalwire-client-sdk/signalwire-client/online) method to opt into receiving them.

## WebSocket Notifications

To receive incoming call notifications over WebSocket, call `client.online()` with an [`incomingCallHandlers`] object:

```javascript
client.online({
  incomingCallHandlers: {
    websocket: (callInvite) => {
      const callerName = callInvite.invite.details?.caller_id_name;
      const callerNumber = callInvite.invite.details?.caller_id_number;
      
      // to accept:
      const roomSession = await callInvite.invite.accept(params);
      
      // to reject:
      callInvite.invite.reject();
    },
  },
});
```

When an incoming call arrives, the `websocket` handler receives a `callInvite` object containing:
- `callInvite.invite.details` - call and caller information [IncomingInvite](/sdks/signalwire-client-sdk/types#incominginvite)
- `callInvite.invite.accept()` - accepts the call and returns a [`CallSession`](/sdks/signalwire-client-sdk/call-session)
- `callInvite.invite.reject()` - rejects the call

[`incomingCallHandlers`]: /sdks/signalwire-client-sdk/types#incomingcallhandlers


## Push Notifications

To receive calls and VoIP notifications directly to your mobile application (iOS or Android), set up a proxy server
that receives websocket notifications and forwards the invite to your application using APNS for iOS or FCM for Android.
