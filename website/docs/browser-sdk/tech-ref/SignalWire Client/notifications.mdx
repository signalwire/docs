# Notifications

If you've initialized the SignalWire Client with a subscriber token, you can opt into receiving notifications 
whenever that subscriber address is called using WebSockets.

The WebSocket notifications are delivered over the WebSocket connection **while your application is active**, and you have
called the `online()` method to opt into receiving them.

To receive incoming call notifications over WebSocket, call `client.online()` with an `incomingCallHandlers` object:

```javascript
client.online({
  incomingCallHandlers: {
    websocket: (callInvite) => {
      const callerName = callInvite.invite.details?.caller_id_name;
      const callerNumber = callInvite.invite.details?.caller_id_number;
      
      // to accept:
      const roomSession = await callInvite.invite.accept(params);
      
      // to reject:
      callInvite.invite.reject();
    },
  },
});
```

When an incoming call arrives, the `websocket` handler receives a `callInvite` object containing:
- `callInvite.invite.details` - call and caller information `IncomingInvite`
- `callInvite.invite.accept()` - accepts the call and returns a `CallSession`
- `callInvite.invite.reject()` - rejects the call
