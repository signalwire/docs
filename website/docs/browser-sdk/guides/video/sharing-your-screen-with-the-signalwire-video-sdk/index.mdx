# Screen Sharing

SignalWire Video API allows you to host real-time video calls and conferences on your website. In this guide, we'll learn to add screen sharing ability in your video call interface.

## Getting Started

It is incredibly easy to allow screen sharing on any project that already uses the SignalWire Video JS SDK. However, if you haven't yet set up a video conference project using the Video SDK, you can check out the [Simple Video Demo](/video/getting-started/simple-video-demo) guide first.

## Adding a Screen Share feature

To start sharing the screen, you need to call the [RoomSession.startScreenShare()](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session#startscreenshare) method. This will make the browser prompt your user with the browser's screen share dialog.

After the user selects which screen or tab to share, SignalWire Video SDK will automatically add a new video feed with your screen's contents to the video call.

By default, the shared screen will take full-screen role, and a participant will be shown in the top-right corner of the video.

[RoomSession.startScreenShare()](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session#startscreenshare) asynchronously returns a [RoomSessionScreenShare](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session-screenshare) object.  
To stop the video feed, simply call the [RoomSessionScreenShare.leave()](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session-screenshare#leave) method.

### Toggle screen share with an HTML button

To put it all together, this is how you would toggle screen share with a button:

```javascript
// Assuming your Room object is named `roomSession`

let screenShareObj;
async function toggle_screen_share() {
  if (roomSession === undefined) return;

  if (screenShareObj === undefined) {
    screenShareObj = await roomSession.startScreenShare();
  } else {
    screenShareObj.leave();
    screenShareObj = undefined;
  }
}
```

You can call the `toggle_screen_share` function from your "Share Screen" button in HTML like so:

```html
<button onclick="toggle_screen_share()">Toggle Screen Share</button>
```
