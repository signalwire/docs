# Interactive Live Streaming

In case of large events, scalability is key. If you need to broadcast your live
video event to a large audience, we have a couple of solutions.

As a first option, you can use [RTMP Streaming](/sdks/browser-sdk/guides/video/streaming-to-youtube-and-other-platforms).
With RTMP Streaming, you can stream the audio and video of the video room to an
external service such as YouTube, from where your audience can watch.

Streaming with RTMP works fine in many cases, but sometimes you may need more
flexibility. What if you want to temporarily bring a member from the audience on
stage, for example to ask or answer a question? What if you want your own custom
UI? To address these advanced use cases, we support _Interactive Live Streaming_.

## What is Interactive Live Streaming

You can use Interactive Live Streaming with any of your video rooms. When
streaming, a room can have two different kinds of participants: audience and
members.

An _audience participant_ can only watch and listen: their own media is not
going to be shared. On the other hand, a _member_ is the typical videoconference
room member: they can watch and listen, but their own media is also shared with
all other participants in the room. Depending on their permissions, members can
also perform other actions, such as changing the layout of the room or playing
videos.

When streaming, audience participants can be _promoted_ to members and,
vice-versa, members can be _demoted_ to audience participants.

:::info Demo Application

To try Interactive Live Streaming in a demo application that we built for you,
check out our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/signalwire/examples/tree/main/Video/Interactive-Live-Streaming).

## Joining a room

When using the [Browser SDK](/sdks/browser-sdk), the kind of
[Video Room Token](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/video/create-room-token) that you
get determines whether you join the room as audience or as a member.

### Joining as audience

To join as audience, specify `"join_as": "audience"` when creating a token.

```bash
curl -L -X POST "https://$SPACE_URL/api/video/room_tokens" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -u "$PROJECT_ID:$API_TOKEN" \
  --data-raw '{
    "room_name": "my_room",
    "user_name": "John Smith",
    "join_as": "audience"
  }'
```

Then use the returned token to initialize a
[RoomSession](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session).

### Joining as a member

To join as an audience member, specify `"join_as": "member"` when creating a token.

```bash
curl -L -X POST "https://$SPACE_URL/api/video/room_tokens" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -u "$PROJECT_ID:$API_TOKEN" \
  --data-raw '{
    "room_name": "my_room",
    "user_name": "John Smith",
    "join_as": "member"
  }'
```

Then use the returned token to initialize a
[RoomSession](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session):

```js
import * as SignalWire from "@signalwire/js";

const roomSession = new SignalWire.Video.RoomSession({
  token: "<YourRoomToken>",
  rootElement: document.getElementById("yourVideoElement"),
});

roomSession.join();
```

For more information about using tokens to join a video room, please refer to
our [Simple Video Demo](/video/getting-started/simple-video-demo).
Follow that guide to learn the basics about instantiating custom video rooms
using the SDKs.

## Promoting and demoting

Using the SDKs, you can programmatically promote and demote participants,
to allow the audience participants to interact with the room and vice-versa.

To promote a member, use the
[promote](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session#promote)
method:

```js
await roomSession.promote({
  memberId: "de550c0c-3fac-4efd-b06f-b5b8614b8966",
  mediaAllowed: "all",
  permissions: [
    "room.self.audio_mute",
    "room.self.audio_unmute",
    "room.self.video_mute",
    "room.self.video_unmute",
    "room.list_available_layouts",
  ],
});
```

Only members can promote other participants. As you can observe from the code
snippet above, you can specify a set of permissions to assign to the new member.

The `memberId` value identifies the id of the audience participant that you want to promote.

Demoting a member back to the audience, instead, is performed by the
[demote](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session#demote)
method:

```js
await roomSession.demote({
  memberId: "de550c0c-3fac-4efd-b06f-b5b8614b8966",
  mediaAllowed: "all",
});
```

## Wrap up

We have seen how to use Interactive Live Streaming to easily build next
generation communication platforms. Make sure to check out our [technical documentation](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session#promote).
