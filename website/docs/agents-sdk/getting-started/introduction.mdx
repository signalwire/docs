# Getting Started


> **Summary**: Everything you need to install the SignalWire Agents SDK, create your first voice AI agent, and connect it to the SignalWire platform.

## What You'll Learn

This chapter walks you through the complete setup process:

1. **Introduction** - Understand what the SDK does and key concepts
2. **Installation** - Install the SDK and verify it works
3. **Quick Start** - Build your first agent in under 5 minutes
4. **Development Environment** - Set up a professional development workflow
5. **Exposing Your Agent** - Make your agent accessible to SignalWire using ngrok

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your system
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- A **terminal/command line** interface
- A **text editor or IDE** (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- (Optional) A **SignalWire account** for testing with real phone calls

## Time to Complete

| Section | Time |
|---------|------|
| Introduction | 5 min read |
| Installation | 5 min |
| Quick Start | 5 min |
| Dev Environment | 10 min |
| Exposing Agents | 10 min |
| **Total** | **~35 minutes** |

## By the End of This Chapter

You will have:

- A working voice AI agent
- Accessible via public URL
- Ready to connect to SignalWire phone numbers

## What is the SignalWire Agents SDK?

The SignalWire Agents SDK lets you create **voice AI agents** - intelligent phone-based assistants that can:

- Answer incoming phone calls automatically
- Have natural conversations using AI (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Execute custom functions (check databases, call APIs, etc.)
- Transfer calls, play audio, and manage complex call flows
- Scale from development to production seamlessly

## How It Works

<Frame caption="High-Level Architecture" className="diagram">
  ![High-Level Architecture](@image/agents-sdk-manual/01_01_introduction_diagram2.webp)
</Frame>

**The flow:**

1. A caller dials your SignalWire phone number
2. SignalWire requests instructions from your agent (via HTTP)
3. Your agent returns **SWML** (SignalWire Markup Language) - a JSON document describing how to handle the call
4. SignalWire's AI talks to the caller based on your configuration
5. When the AI needs to perform actions, it calls your **SWAIG functions** (webhooks)
6. Your functions return results, and the AI continues the conversation

## Key Concepts

### Agent

An **Agent** is your voice AI application. It's a Python class that:

- Defines the AI's personality and behavior (via prompts)
- Provides functions the AI can call (SWAIG functions)
- Configures voice, language, and AI parameters
- Runs as a web server that responds to SignalWire requests

```python
from signalwire_agents import AgentBase


class MyAgent(AgentBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="my-agent")
        # Configure your agent here
```

### SWML (SignalWire Markup Language)

**SWML** is a JSON format that tells SignalWire how to handle calls. Your agent generates SWML automatically - you don't write it by hand.

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "sections": {
    "main": [
      {"answer": {}},
      {"ai": {
        "prompt": {"text": "You are a helpful assistant..."},
        "SWAIG": {"functions": [...]}
      }}
    ]
  }
}
```

### SWAIG Functions

**SWAIG** (SignalWire AI Gateway) functions are tools your AI can use during a conversation. When a caller asks something that requires action, the AI calls your function.

```python
@agent.tool(description="Look up a customer by phone number")
def lookup_customer(args: dict, raw_data: dict = None) -> SwaigFunctionResult:
    phone_number = args.get("phone_number", "")
    customer = database.find(phone_number)
    return SwaigFunctionResult(f"Customer: {customer.name}, Account: {customer.id}")
```

### Skills

**Skills** are reusable plugins that add capabilities to your agent. The SDK includes built-in skills for common tasks:

- `datetime` - Get current time and date
- `web_search` - Search the web
- `weather_api` - Get weather information
- `math` - Perform calculations

```python
agent.add_skill("datetime")
agent.add_skill("web_search", google_api_key="...")
```

## What You Can Build

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Customer Service** | Answer FAQs, route calls, collect information |
| **Appointment Scheduling** | Book, reschedule, and cancel appointments |
| **Surveys & Feedback** | Conduct phone surveys, collect responses |
| **IVR Systems** | Interactive voice menus with AI intelligence |
| **Receptionist** | Screen calls, take messages, transfer to staff |
| **Notifications** | Outbound calls for alerts, reminders, confirmations |

The SDK includes prefab agents for common scenarios (InfoGatherer, FAQBot, Survey, Receptionist) that you can customize or use as starting points.

## SDK Features

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| Core | AgentBase class, SWAIG function decorators, Prompt building (POM), Voice & language config, Speech hints, Built-in skills |
| Advanced | Multi-step workflows (Contexts), Multi-agent servers, Call recording, Call transfer (SIP, PSTN), State management, Vector search integration |
| Deployment | Local dev server, Production (uvicorn), AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, CGI mode, Docker/Kubernetes |
| Developer Tools | swaig-test CLI, SWML debugging, Function testing, Serverless simulation |
| Prefab Agents | InfoGathererAgent, FAQBotAgent, SurveyAgent, ReceptionistAgent, ConciergeAgent |
| DataMap | Direct API calls from SignalWire, No webhook server needed, Variable expansion, Response mapping |

## Minimal Example

Here's the simplest possible agent:

```python
from signalwire_agents import AgentBase


class HelloAgent(AgentBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="hello")
        self.prompt_add_section("Role", "You are a friendly assistant.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = HelloAgent()
    agent.run()
```

This agent:

- Starts a web server on port 3000
- Returns SWML that configures an AI assistant
- Uses the default voice and language settings
- Has no custom functions (just conversation)

## Next Steps

Now that you understand what the SDK does, let's install it and build something real.
