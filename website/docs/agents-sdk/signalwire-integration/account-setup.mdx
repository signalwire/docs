## Architecture

</Frame>

## Required URLs

Your agent needs to be accessible at these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/` | POST | Main SWML document |
| `/swaig` | POST | SWAIG function calls |

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS for production
- Enable basic auth for SWML endpoints
- Use secure tokens for SWAIG functions
- Don't expose sensitive data in prompts
- Monitor for unusual call patterns

Let's start with setting up your SignalWire account.

## Create Account

1. Go to [signalwire.com](https://signalwire.com)
2. Click [Sign Up](https://id.signalwire.com/onboarding) or [Login](https://id.signalwire.com/login/session/new)
3. Complete registration with email and password
4. Verify your email address

**Note:** If you have problems verifying your account, email support@signalwire.com

## Create a Project

After logging in:

1. Navigate to Projects in the dashboard
2. Click "Create New Project"
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "Voice Agents")
4. Select your use case

## Space Name

Your Space Name is your unique SignalWire identifier.

**URL Format:** `https://YOUR-SPACE-NAME.signalwire.com`

**Example:** `https://mycompany.signalwire.com`

**You'll need this for:**
- API authentication
- Dashboard access
- SWML webhook configuration

## API Credentials

Get your API credentials from the project:

1. Go to [API Credentials](https://my.signalwire.com/?page=/credentials)
2. Note your Project ID
3. Create an API Token if needed

| Credential | Format |
|------------|--------|
| Project ID | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| API Token | `PTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| Space Name | `your-space` |

**Keep these secure - don't commit to version control!**

## Environment Variables

Set these for your agent:

```bash
export SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export SIGNALWIRE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
export SIGNALWIRE_SPACE_NAME="your-space"
```

## Dashboard Overview

| Section | Purpose |
