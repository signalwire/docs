# RoomSessionMember

[video-roomsession]: video-roomsession.mdx

Represents a member of a room session. You receive instances of this type by listening to room events, for example on a [RoomSession][video-roomsession] object.

:::info

The state of RoomSessionMember objects, for example `member.visible`, is
immutable. When you receive instances of RoomSessionMember from event
listeners, the state of the member always refers to that specific point in
time and remains fixed for the whole lifetime of the object.

:::

### Example

Getting a RoomSessionMember instance when a user joins a [RoomSession][video-roomsession]:

```js
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

// Intialize the SignalWire Client
const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

// Access the video client from the SignalWire client
const videoClient = client.video;

// Setup listerner for when a room starts
await videoClient.listen({
  onRoomStarted: async (roomsession) => {
    roomsession.listen({
      onMemberJoined: (member) => {
        console.log("RoomSessionMember:", member);
      },
    });
  }
});
```

## **Methods**

### audioMute

▸ **audioMute**(): `Promise<void>`

Mutes the outbound audio for this member (e.g., the one coming from a microphone). The other participants will not hear audio from the muted participant anymore.

#### Returns

`Promise<void>`

#### Example

In this example, we mute the audio of the member when they join the room.
This example assumes that you already have a [`RoomSession`][video-roomsession] active
and members are joining the room.

```js
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

// Intialize the SignalWire Client
const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

// Access the video client from the SignalWire client
const videoClient = client.video;

// Setup listerner for when a room starts
await videoClient.listen({
  onRoomStarted: async (roomsession) => {
    roomsession.listen({
      // Mute the audio of the RoomSession member when they join the room
      onMemberJoined: async (member) => {
        await member.audioMute();
      },
      onMemberUpdated: async (member) => {
        console.log("Member Updated:", member.name);
      }
    });
  }
});
```

---

### audioUnmute

▸ **audioUnmute**(): `Promise<void>`

#### Returns

`Promise<void>`

#### Example

In this example, we mute the audio of the member when they join the room and
unmute it after 5 seconds. 
This example assumes that you already have a [`RoomSession`][video-roomsession] active
and members are joining the room.

```js
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

// Intialize the SignalWire Client
const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

// Access the video client from the SignalWire client

await videoClient.listen({
  onRoomStarted: async (roomsession) => {
    roomsession.listen({
      // Mute the audio of the RoomSession member when they join the room and unmute it after 5 seconds
      onMemberJoined: async (member) => {
        await member.audioMute();
        setTimeout(async () => {
          await member.audioUnmute();
        }, 5000);
      },
      onMemberUpdated: async (member) => {
        console.log("Member Updated:", member.name);
