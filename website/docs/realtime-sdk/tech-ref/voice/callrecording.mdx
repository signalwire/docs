# CallRecording

Represents a recording of a call.

Obtain instances of this class by starting a Recording with one of the following methods:

- [`Call.record`][voice-call]
- [`Call.recordAudio`][voice-call-1]

#### Example

Record the audio of the call as soon as the other party answers the phone. We
also print the ID of the recording and, when the call ends, the URL (which can be used
to download the recording).

```js
import { SignalWire, Voice } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const call = await client.voice.dialPhone({
  from: "+YYYYYYYYYY",
  to: "+XXXXXXXXXX",
});

await call.playTTS({ text: "This call will be recorded." });

// Start recording
await call.recordAudio({
  direction: "both",
  endSilenceTimeout: 0,
  terminators: "",
  listen: {
  onStarted: async (recording) => {
      console.log("Recording started", recording.state);
      call.playTTS({
        text: "This is a recording test."
      });

      // Wait 5 seconds
      setTimeout(async () => {
      // Stop recording
      await recording.stop();
      }, 5000);

  },
  onEnded: async (recording) => {
      console.log("Recording ended", recording.state);
      call.hangup();
    }
  }
}).onStarted();
```
