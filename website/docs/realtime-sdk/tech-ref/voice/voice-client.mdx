## **Voice Client**

### Setting up a Voice Client
To create a `Voice` client, you will need to create a [`SignalWire Realtime-Client`][signalwire-realtime-client] first.
After the `SignalWire Client` is created, you can access the `Voice` client using the `voice` namespace.

#### Example
```javascript
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const voiceClient = client.voice
```

## **Methods**

### dial

▸ **dial**(`params`): `Promise`\<[`Call`][call]>

Makes an outbound Call and waits until it has been answered or hung up. This is an advanced method that lets you call multiple devices in parallel or series: for simpler use cases, see [dialPhone][dialphone] and [dialSip][dialsip].

With this method you can specify a configuration of devices to call in series and/or in parallel: as soon as one device answers the call, the returned promise is resolved. You specify a configuration through a [VoiceDeviceBuilder][voicedevicebuilder] object.

#### Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="VoiceDeviceBuilder" required={true}>
  The device builder specifying the devices to call. See [`VoiceDeviceBuilder`][voicedevicebuilder].
</APIField>

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`Call`][call]>

A call object.

#### Example

Calls a phone number. If the number doesn't answer within 30 seconds, calls two different SIP endpoints in parallel.

```js
import { SignalWire, Voice } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const voiceClient = client.voice

const devices = new Voice.DeviceBuilder()
  .add(Voice.DeviceBuilder.Phone({ from: "+XXXXXX", to: "+YYYYYY", timeout: 30 }))
  .add([
    Voice.DeviceBuilder.Sip({ from: "sip:aaa@bbb.cc", to: "sip:xxx@yyy.zz" }),
    Voice.DeviceBuilder.Sip({ from: "sip:aaa@bbb.cc", to: "sip:ppp@qqq.rr" })
  ]);

try {
  const call = await voiceClient.dial(devices);
  console.log("Call answered", call);
} catch (e) {
  console.log("Call not answered", e);
}
```

### dialPhone

▸ **dialPhone**(`params`): `Promise`\<[`Call`][call-5]>

Makes an outbound call to a PSTN number.

#### Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="object" required={true}>
  Object containing the parameters for dialing a phone number.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.to" type="string" required={true}>
  The party you are attempting to call.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.from" type="string">
  The party the call is coming from. Must be a SignalWire number or SIP endpoint that you own.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.timeout" type="number">
  The time, in seconds, the call will ring before it is considered unanswered.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.maxPricePerMinute" type="number">
  The maximum price in USD acceptable for the call to be created. If the rate for the call is greater than this value, the call will not be created. If not set, all calls will be created. Price can have a maximum of four decimal places, i.e. `0.0075`.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.listen" type="object">
  Object that contains callbacks to listen for events. List of Call events can be found [here][call-events].
</APIField>

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`Call`][call]>

A call object.

#### Example

```js
import { SignalWire, Voice } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const voiceClient = client.voice

try {
  const call = await voiceClient.dialPhone({
    from: "+YYYYYYYYYY",
    to: "+XXXXXXXXXX",
    timeout: 30
  });
  console.log("Call answered.", call);
} catch (e) {
  console.log("Call not answered.", e);
}
```

#### Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="object" required={true}>
  Object containing the parameters for dialing a SIP endpoint.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.from" type="string" required={true}>
  The party the call is coming from. Must be a SignalWire number or SIP endpoint that you own.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.to" type="string" required={true}>
