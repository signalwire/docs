# Client

A [Chat][chat] client is used to listen for events on a channel and to publish messages into a channel.
Members of a channel can also be retrieved and updated using a Chat client.

## **Chat Client**
### Setting up a Chat Client

To create a `Chat` client, you will need to create a [`SignalWire Realtime-Client`][signalwire-realtime-client] first.
After the `SignalWire Client` is created, you can access the `Chat` client using the `chat` namespace.

#### Example
```javascript
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const chatClient = client.chat;
```

---

## **Methods**

### getMemberState

▸ **getMemberState**(`params`): `Promise<\{ channels: Record<string, ChatChannelState> \}>`

Returns the states of a member in the specified channels.

#### Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="object" required={true}>
  Object containing the parameters of the method.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.channels" type="string | string[]">
  Channels for which to get the state.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.memberId" type="string" required={true}>
  ID of the member for which to get the state.
</APIField>

#### Returns

`Promise<{ channels: Record<string, ChatChannelState> }>`

A promise that resolves to an object containing the states of the member in the specified channels.

#### Example

In this example, we fetch the state of the member `User1` in the channel
`channel1` and print it to the console.

```js
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const chatClient = client.chat;

let usesId = 'User1'; // Assumes a member with this id already exists and has joined the channel.

const s = await chatClient.getMemberState({
  channels: "channel1", // or a list of channels like: ["channel1", "channel2"]
  memberId: usesId
});

console.log(`The state of ${usesId} is: ${JSON.stringify(s.channels.channel1.state, null, 2)}`);
```

---

### getMembers

▸ **getMembers**(`params`): `Promise<{ members: ChatMemberEntity[] }>`

Returns the list of members in the given channel.

#### Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="object" required={true}>
  Object containing the parameters of the method.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.channel" type="string" required={true}>
  The channel for which to get the list of members.
</APIField>

#### Returns

`Promise<{ members: ChatMemberEntity[] }>`

A promise that resolves to an object containing the list of members in the given channel.

#### Example
In this example, we fetch all the members in the channel `channel1` and print the
number of members and the list of members to the console.

```js
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const chatClient = client.chat;

const m = await chatClient.getMembers({ channel: "channel1" });

console.log(`There are a total of ${m.members.length} members in channel1.
The list of members are: ${m.members.map(m => m.id).join(", ")}`);
```

---

### getMessages

▸ **getMessages**(`params`): `Promise<{ cursor: PaginationCursor, messages: ChatMessageEntity[] }>`

Returns the list of messages that were sent to the specified channel.

#### Parameters

<APIField name="params" type="object" required={true}>
  Object containing the parameters of the method.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.channel" type="string" required={true}>
  Channel for which to retrieve the messages.
</APIField>

<APIField name="params.cursor" type="PaginationCursor">
  Cursor for pagination. See [`PaginationCursor`][paginationcursor].
</APIField>

#### Returns

`Promise<{ cursor: PaginationCursor, messages: ChatMessageEntity[] }>`

A promise that resolves to an object containing the list of messages that were sent to the specified channel.

#### Example

In this example, we fetch all the messages sent in the channel `channel1` and print them to the console.
We use the cursor to fetch the next set of messages until the cursor is null, indicating that there are no more messages to fetch.

```js
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const chatClient = client.chat;

let pageNumber = 1;
let cursor = null;

while (true) {
  const m = await chatClient.getMessages({
    channel: "channel1",
    cursor: cursor ? { after: cursor } : undefined
  });

  console.log(`Page ${pageNumber}: fetched ${m.messages.length} messages
  ${JSON.stringify(m.messages, null, 2)}`);

  // Check if 'after' is null, indicating no more messages to fetch
  if (!m.cursor.after) {
    console.log("No more messages");
    break;
  }
  // Update the cursor to fetch next set of messages
  cursor = m.cursor.after;
  pageNumber++;
}
```

</APIField>

#### Returns

`Promise<ChatEvents>`

A promise that resolves to a `ChatEvents` object that you can use to view the current state or results of the event.

#### Example

In this example, we listen for the `onMessageReceived` event on the channel
`my-channel` and print the message to the console.

```js
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const chatClient = client.chat;

await chatClient.listen({
  channels: ["my-channel"],
  onMessageReceived: (message) => {
    console.log(message);

We then fetch the state of the member and print it to the console.

```js
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const chatClient = client.chat;

let usesId = 'User1'; // Assumes a member with this id already exists and has joined the channel.

// set the member state
await chatClient.setMemberState({
  memberId: usesId,
  channels: "channel1", // or a list of channels like: ["channel1", "channel2"]
  state: {
    online: true,
