# ChatMember

This class represents a member in a chat. A `ChatMember` object is received in the `onMemberJoined`, `onMemberUpdated`, and `onMemberLeft` event handlers when listening to chat events.

## **Properties**

<APIField name="id" type="string" required={true}>
  The id of this member.
</APIField>

<APIField name="channel" type="string" required={true}>
  The channel of this member.
</APIField>

<APIField name="state" type="Record<any, any>" required={true}>
  The state of this member.
</APIField>

## **Example**

Listening for member events and accessing `ChatMember` properties:

```js
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "your-project-id", token: "your-api-token" });

await client.chat.listen({
  channels: ["my-channel"],
  onMemberJoined: (member) => {
    console.log("Member joined:", member.id);
    console.log("Channel:", member.channel);
    console.log("State:", member.state);
  },
  onMemberUpdated: (member) => {
    console.log("Member updated:", member.id);
    console.log("New state:", member.state);
  },
  onMemberLeft: (member) => {
    console.log("Member left:", member.id);
  }
});
```
