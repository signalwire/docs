# Compatibility API

This API may look very similar to other, existing APIs you've used before â€” on purpose!
The SignalWire Compatibility REST API is designed to make migrating your existing phone or messaging application easy and quick,
while giving you access to our next generation APIs and endpoints to help you take your application to the next level.

## Examples

Here are a couple of ways you can use the XML and the REST cXML APIs.

### XML

Answering calls with Text-To-Speech and connecting to another number:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <!-- Say and Dial are examples of Verbs -->
  <Say>Connecting you...</Say>
  <Dial>
    <!-- Number is an example of a Dial Noun -->
    <Number>+15551234567</Number>
  </Dial>
</Response>
```

### REST

Starting a new call:

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://example.signalwire.com/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/my-project-id/Calls \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
     --data 'From=+15551234567' \
     --data 'To=+15553456789'
```
