# Add a Participant

In order to add a participant to a conference call, from the cXML REST API, create an 
[outbound call](../calls/create.mdx) 
to the participant's phone number and specify a cXML document that consists of something similar to:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Dial>
    <Conference>your-conference-name</Conference>
  </Dial>
</Response>
```

When the call is connected, the desired participant will be added to the conference call.
