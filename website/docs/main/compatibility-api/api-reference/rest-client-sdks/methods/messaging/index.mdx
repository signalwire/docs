# Messages

A **Message** is an inbound or outbound message sent or received by your SignalWire project. 
Messages are identified by a unique, random ID, and can have attachments, called Media, associated with them. 
These Media files are managed separately from the Messages themselves, and are stored in **[Media](../media/index.mdx)** subresource objects.
To retrieve a list of the media associated with a message, use the Media subresource for that Message instance.

In addition to the [standard request parameters](/compatibility-api/cxml/messaging#request-parameters),
