# Recordings

A Recording represents a recording of a voice or conference call. 
It allows you to see meta information about the recording as well as access the media file itself.

Recordings can be initiated using the [`<Record>`](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/record) verb, 
by setting the `record` attribute for [Calls](../calls/index.mdx),
or by using [Conferences](../conferences/index.mdx).
