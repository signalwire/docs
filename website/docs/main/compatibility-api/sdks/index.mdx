# Libraries and SDKs

SignalWire has clients in a number of different languages that make using the SignalWire Compatibility API possible with your existing application. They are also built to make migrating from other service providers to SignalWire quick and easy.

The Compatibility SDK has two primary namespaces:

 - **REST Client namespace:** SignalWire maintains SDKs in popular languages for the Compatibility REST Client. These SDKs streamline the process of requests to the REST API endpoints from within your application.
 - **cXML namespace:** The cXML namespace of the Compatibility SDK does not directly make API calls. Instead, these SDKs or libraries work as simple XML builders that enable you to easily generate cXML within your language of choice. This XML is generated in a single string which SignalWire's servers parse. Learn more by reading our guide to the [cXML Specification](../cxml/index.mdx).

## Installing the SDK and Initializing the Client

  <Tabs groupId="cxml-api">

  <TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

    <h3>Installing the SDK</h3>

    Install the package using NPM:

    ```js
    npm install @signalwire/compatibility-api
    ```

    <h3>Initializing the Client</h3>

    In order to use the NodeJS client, you must get your `Space URL`, `Project ID`, and `API Token`
    from your SignalWire Dashboard and initialize the client:

    ```js
    const { RestClient } = require("@signalwire/compatibility-api");

    const client = RestClient(
    "your-project",
    "your-token",
    { signalwireSpaceUrl: "example.signalwire.com" }
    );

    // You can then use client to make calls, send messages, and more.
    ```


    <h4>Using Environment Variables</h4>

    Alternatively, you can use an environment variable to pass the Space URL:

    ```makefile
      SIGNALWIRE_SPACE_URL=example.signalwire.com
    ```

    With this approach, `signalwireSpaceUrl` will be pulled from the `.env` file instead of having to be passed as an argument:

    ```js
      const { RestClient } = require("@signalwire/compatibility-api");

      const client = RestClient(
      "your-project",
      "your-token"
      );
    ```

    <h4>Migrating from Twilio</h4>

    You can easily migrate from Twilio with minimal changes.

    To get started, you will need to replace the `Twilio` client with the `SignalWire` client and update the `from` number
    to a valid SignalWire number.

:::info Make sure to change the "From" number!
When migrating to SignalWire, make sure to replace the `from` numbers with a valid SignalWire number.
:::

    ```js
    // Replace these lines:
    const twilio = require('twilio')
    const response = new twilio.twiml.VoiceResponse()

    // With:
    const { RestClient } = require('@signalwire/compatibility-api')
    const response = new RestClient.LaML.VoiceResponse()

    // Now use response like you did before!
    response.say('Hey, welcome to SignalWire!')
    ```

    <h3>Installing the SDK</h3>

    Install the package using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install signalwire
    ```

    <h3>Initializing the Client</h3>

    In order to use the Python client, you must get your `Space URL`, `Project ID`, and `API Token`
    from your SignalWire Dashboard and initialize the client:

    ```python
    from signalwire.rest import Client as signalwire_client

    client = signalwire_client(
    "your-project",
    "your-token",
    signalwire_space_url="example.signalwire.com"
    )

    # You can then use client to make calls, send messages, and more.
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use an environment variable to set up the Space URL. Place the Space URL in your `.env` file:

    ```makefile
    SIGNALWIRE_SPACE_URL=example.signalwire.com
    ```

    With this approach, `signalwire_space_url` will be pulled from the `.env` for you:

    ```python
    from signalwire.rest import Client as signalwire_client
    client = signalwire_client('your-project', 'your-token')
    ```

    <h4>Migrating from Twilio</h4>

    to a valid SignalWire number.

:::info Make sure to change the "From" number!

    ```python
    # Replace these lines:
    from twilio.rest import Client
    client = Client('account_sid', 'auth_token')

    # With:
    from signalwire.rest import Client as signalwire_client
    client = signalwire_client('your-project', 'your-token', signalwire_space_url = 'example.signalwire.com')

    # Now use client variable like you did before!
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ruby" label="Ruby">

    <h3>Installing the SDK</h3>

    Install the package via rubygems:

    ```bash
    gem install signalwire
    ```

    ---

    <h3>Initializing the Client</h3>

    In order to use the Ruby client, you must get your `Space URL`, `Project ID`, and `API Token`
    from your SignalWire Dashboard and initialize the client:

    ```ruby
    require 'signalwire/sdk'
    @client = Signalwire::REST::Client.new 'your-project', 'your-token', signalwire_space_url: "example.signalwire.com"

    # You can then use @client to make calls, send messages, and more.
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use an environment variable to set up the Space URL. Place the Space URL in your `.env` file:

    ```makefile
    SIGNALWIRE_SPACE_URL=example.signalwire.com
    ```

    With this approach, `signalwire_space_url` will be pulled from the `.env` for you:

    ```ruby
    require 'signalwire/sdk'
    @client = Signalwire::REST::Client.new 'your-project', 'your-token'
    ```

    Or, you can configure your SignalWire subdomain with an initializer:

    ```ruby
    require 'signalwire/sdk'

    Signalwire::Sdk.configure do |config|
      config.hostname = "example.signalwire.com"
    end
    ```
