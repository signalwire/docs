The `<Prompt>` noun allows you to customize the default prompts used by `<Pay>`.

When SignalWire executes `<Pay>` CXML instructions without `<Prompt>`, the caller will hear default prompts for each step of the
payment process. You can modify what the caller hears for a given payment step by nesting `<Prompt>` within `<Pay>`'s opening
and closing tags.

You can customize prompts using either:
- Text-to-speech by nesting `<Say>` CXML within `<Prompt>`
- Pre-recorded audio by nesting `<Play>` CXML within `<Prompt>`

## Payment Steps

There are seven payment steps in the `<Pay>` process where prompts can be customized (see the `for` attribute section below).
Each step that you wish to customize requires its own `<Prompt>` element.

| `attempt`<span className="optional-arg">optional</span> | Integer from `1`-`10` | - | Specifies which attempt number this prompt should be used for. Useful for providing more detailed instructions after failed attempts. |
