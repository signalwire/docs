The `<Leave>` verb transfers a call out of the queue containing that call. It then returns the flow of execution to verb following the `<Enqueue>` that placed this call into the queue.

## Verb Attributes

The `<Leave>` verb does not support any attributes.

## Examples

### Leaving a Closed Queue

<Tabs groupId="cxml-api">
  <TabItem value="XML">

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <Enqueue waitUrl="https://example.com/wait.xml">support</Enqueue>
    <Say>Customer support is now closed. Please call back on the next business day. Thank you.</Say>
</Response>
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
const { RestClient } = require("@signalwire/compatibility-api");
const response = new RestClient.LaML.VoiceResponse();

response.enqueue({ waitUrl: "https://example.com/hold-music.xml" }, "support");
response.say(
  "Customer support is now closed. Please call back on the next business day. Thank you."
);
console.log(response.toString());
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="C#">

```csharp
using Twilio.TwiML;
using System;


class Example
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var response = new VoiceResponse();
        response.Enqueue("support", waitUrl: new Uri("https://example.com/wait.xml"));
        response.Say("Customer support is now closed. Please call back on the next business day. Thank you.");

        Console.WriteLine(response.ToString());;
    }
}
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Python">

```python
from signalwire.voice_response import VoiceResponse, Enqueue, Say

response = VoiceResponse()
response.enqueue('support', wait_url='https://example.com/wait.xml')
response.say('Customer support is now closed. Please call back on the next business day. Thank you.')

print(response)
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Ruby">

require 'signalwire/sdk'

response = Signalwire::Sdk::VoiceResponse.new do |response|
  response.enqueue(name: 'support', wait_url: 'https://example.com/wait.xml')
  response.say(message: 'Customer support is now closed. Please call back on the next business day. Thank you.')
end

puts response.to_s
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

Callers who are waiting in the queue for customer support will automatically be directed out of the queue after closing hours. SignalWire will notify these callers that they have left the queue and will have to try calling back another day.
