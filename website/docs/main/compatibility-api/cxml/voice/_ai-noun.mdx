[`<Connect>`](./connect.mdx) verb's `<AI>` noun allows the connection to a virtual AI agent.
For example:

<Tabs groupId="cxml-api">
  <TabItem value="XML">

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Connect>
    <AI postPromptURL="https://webhook.site/10d74766-3782-414d-8d40-614dacdaf140">
      <Prompt confidence="0.6">
        You are a recipe bot. You can help me cook any recipe, step by step.
      </Prompt>
      <PostPrompt confidence="0.6">
        Summarize the conversation.
      </PostPrompt>
    </AI>
  </Connect>
</Response>
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="JavaScript">

```js
const { RestClient } = require("@signalwire/compatibility-api");
const response = new RestClient.LaML.VoiceResponse();

const connect = response.connect();

const ai = connect.ai();
ai.setPostPromptURL("https://webhook.site/10d74766-3782-414d-8d40-614dacdaf140");

ai.prompt(
  { confidence: 0.6 },
  "You are a recipe bot. You can help me cook any recipe, step by step."
);

ai.postPrompt({ confidence: 0.6 }, "Summarize the conversation.");

console.log(response.toString());
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

The agent has the ability to perform a number of actions when needed, for example it can hang up the call or send an SMS to the caller.

### `<Prompt>` and `<PostPrompt>` {#prompts}

You can specify two prompts: `<Prompt>` and `<PostPrompt>`.

Any text inside `<Prompt>` will be used as the initial prompt for the AI agent
(it will remain hidden from the user). You typically use `<Prompt>` to instruct
the agent on who it is, what it should do, and what it knows.

Similarly, any text in `<PostPrompt>` will be used after the end of the
conversation with the agent (it will remain hidden from the user, but the
response of the agent will be available in the `postPromptURL` request). You
typically use `<PostPrompt>` to instruct the agent to emit a final message that
you'll consume from your API (e.g., summarizing the conversation, or retrieving
a specific entity — such as a customer id — from the conversation).

Both `<Prompt>` and `<PostPrompt>` accept the following attributes:

|                                                         Attribute |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      `temperature` <span className="optional-arg">optional</span> | What statistical sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|             `topP` <span className="optional-arg">optional</span> | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the [tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Tokenization) with topP probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. Accepts values between 0 and 1. We recommend setting `temperature=1` when altering this parameter. |
|       `confidence` <span className="optional-arg">optional</span> | Confidence threshold, between 0 and 1, needed to consider the current utterance as end of speech. Decreasing this value will reduce the pause after the user speaks, but may introduce false positives.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  `bargeConfidence` <span className="optional-arg">optional</span> | Confidence threshold, between 0 and 1, needed to consider the current utterance as end of speech. This only applies when the user is speaking over the AI agent. Decreasing this value will reduce the time it takes the agent to stop, but may introduce false positives.                                                                                                                                   |
|  `presencePenalty` <span className="optional-arg">optional</span> | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `frequencyPenalty` <span className="optional-arg">optional</span> | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The default values change depending on the prompt type:

|          Attribute | Default for `<Prompt>` | Default for `<PostPrompt>` |
| -----------------: | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
|      `temperature` | 0.3                    | 0.0                        |
|             `topP` | 1.0                    | 1.0                        |
|       `confidence` | 0.6                    | 0.6                        |
|  `bargeConfidence` | 0.3                    | 0.0                        |
|  `presencePenalty` | 0.1                    | 0.0                        |
| `frequencyPenalty` | 0.1                    | 0.0                        |

#### Request parameters for the `postPromptURL` URL {#postPromptURL}

The `postPromptURL` request contains the following parameters:

|                                                                   Parameter |                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                 `content_type` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | Type of content. Its value is "Conversation/Log".                                                         |

### `<Languages>`

You can allow the AI agent to speak more than one language using the
`<Languages>` tag. The agent will pick the correct language appropriately. For
example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Connect>
    <AI postPromptURL="https://webhook.site/10d74766-3782-414d-8d40-614dacdaf140">
      <Prompt>You are a translation bot.</Prompt>
      <PostPrompt>Summarize the conversation.</PostPrompt>
      <Languages>
        <Language code="en-US" name="English" voice="en-US-Neural2-J" />
        <Language code="fr-FR" name="French" voice="fr-FR-Neural2-B" />
      </Languages>
    </AI>
  </Connect>
</Response>
```

Each `<Language>` tag accepts the following attributes:

| Parameter |                                                                                                                                      |
| --------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|    `code` | Language code. For example, `"fr-FR"`.                                                                                               |
|    `name` | Name of the language. For example, `"French"`.                                                                                       |
|   `voice` | Voice to use for the language. The engine is the one specified in the `<AI>`'s `engine` attribute. For example, `"fr-FR-Neural2-B"`. |

#### Supported Codes and Voices

You can find the list of supported `codes` (*languages*) and `voices` [here](/voice/getting-started/voice-and-languages)

### `<SWAIG>` (SignalWire AI Gateway)

You can define a set of functions that the AI agent will be able to invoke.
Functions allow the agent to perform external actions (e.g., sending an SMS) or
gathering data (e.g., the current weather in a specific city). For example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Connect>
    <AI postPromptURL="https://webhook.site/10d74766-3782-414d-8d40-614dacdaf140">
      <Prompt>You are a general-purpose AI bot.</Prompt>
      <PostPrompt>Summarize the conversation.</PostPrompt>
      <SWAIG>
        <Defaults webHookURL="https://example.com/commands.cgi" />
        <Function name="get_weather" argument="The location or name of the city"
		              purpose="To indicate to the user what the current weather is in a provided location.">
          <metavar1>Value1</metavar1>
        </Function>
        <Function name="get_world_time" argument="The name of the city to check the time"
		              purpose="Get the time in a specific location" />
      </SWAIG>
    </AI>
  </Connect>
</Response>
```

In the example above, when needed, the agent will be able to invoke the
`get_weather` or `get_world_time` functions. At each invocation, a request will
be made to the `webHookURL`, which should respond with the result of the
function invocation (for example, `"Sunny"`).

#### `<Defaults>`

In `<SWAIG>`, use the `<Defaults>` tag to set default parameters for all function definitions. The allowed parameters are:

|                                                      Parameter |                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      `webHookURL` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | The webhook to invoke when a function is called.                                      |
| `webHookAuthUser` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | Username for `webHookURL`. Ignored if a username is already provided in `webHookURL`. |
| `webHookAuthPass` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | Password for `webHookURL`. Ignored if a password is already provided in `webHookURL`. |

In the content of the tag you can specify default metadata too, for example:

```xml
<!-- ... -->
  <SWAIG>
    <Defaults webHookURL="https://example.com/commands.cgi">
      <metavar1>Value1</metavar1>
      <metavar2>Value2</metavar2>
    </Defaults>
  </SWAIG>
<!-- ... -->
```

#### `<Function>`

In `<SWAIG>`, use the `<Function>` tag to define a function that the AI agent will be able to invoke when needed. The allowed parameters are:

|                                                      Parameter |                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                                                         `name` | A unique name for the function. For example, `"get_weather"`.                                                |
|                                                     `argument` | A description of the input to the function. For example, `"The location or name of the city"`.               |
|                                                      `purpose` | A description of the context and purpose of the function, to explain the agent when to use it.               |
|      `webHookURL` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | The webhook to invoke when the function is called. [Request parameters](#webHookURL) are sent to the webook. |
| `webHookAuthUser` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | Username for `webHookURL`. Ignored if a username is already provided in `webHookURL`.                        |
| `webHookAuthPass` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | Password for `webHookURL`. Ignored if a password is already provided in `webHookURL`.                        |

In the content of the tag you can specify metadata too, for example:

```xml
<!-- ... -->
  <SWAIG>
    <Function name="get_weather" argument="The location or name of the city"
              purpose="To indicate to the user what the current weather is in a provided location.">
      <metavar1>Value1</metavar1>
      <metavar2>Value2</metavar2>
    </Function>
  </SWAIG>
<!-- ... -->
```

|             `call_log` <span className="optional-arg">object</span> | The complete log of the call, as a JSON object.                                   |
|             `argument` <span className="optional-arg">object</span> | The actual argument to the function. See below for the fields within this object. |

You need to answer the request with a JSON object containing the result. For
example, if your function was called `get_weather`, your webhook would check the
weather in the requested city using a 3rd party API, and then provide the answer
to the agent with the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "response": "It's sunny."
}
```

## Examples

### A Customer Support Agent

The following agent will help customers troubleshoot the most common problems
with their devices. At the end of the conversation, the agent will include in
the `post_prompt_data` field (see [request parameters](#postPromptURL)) a token that will
indicate whether the troubleshooting was successful (`[solved:true]` or
`[solved:false]`). You can use the `postPromptURL` webhook to retrieve this result.

      <Prompt>
        You are a customer support agent for a vacuum cleaner company called "Best Quality Vacuum".
        You are going to help the customer troubleshoot their problem.
        If the vacuum cleaner has lost suction power, the customer needs to empty the container and check for any clogged filter. Filters can be cleaned.
        Sometimes, foreign items can restrict the air flow in the hose. Those can be removed with the help of a long stick.
        If the vacuum does not power on, the customer should check if the battery is charged by pressing the blue button to see the percentage of charge.
        Start by asking the customer what their issue is.
      </Prompt>
      <PostPrompt>
        Did the customer solve the issue? Answer with "true" or "false" in square brackets after the "solved" keyword (e.g, `[solved:true]`).
        Then, summarize the conversation.
