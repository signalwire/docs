Fax cXML is a set of actions defined in an XML document you can use to tell SignalWire what to do when you receive an incoming fax.

## Overview

When a fax is sent to one of your SignalWire phone numbers, SignalWire looks up the Fax cXML document from the URL you configured,
and reads the instructions you provided to determine what to do.

Fax cXML allows you to control what SignalWire will do when you receive an incoming fax.

## Request

SignalWire makes an HTTP request to your configured endpoint just like a regular web form submission (POST) or page load (GET). The request includes contextual information about the fax, allowing you to respond dynamically and fluidly to the fax to meet the needs of your application.

You can configure the endpoint URL and HTTP Method in your phone number settings panel on your SignalWire Dashboard, or via the REST API.

## Request Parameters

SignalWire sends the following parameters, as either URL query parameters or POST parameters, to your endpoint when it receives a fax:

|                                                 Parameter |                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------: | ---------------------------------------------- |
|     `FaxSid` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | A unique identifier for the fax.               |
| `AccountSid` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | The account that the fax was sent from.        |
|         `To` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | The number or SIP URI the fax will be sent to. |
|       `From` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | The number or SIP URI the fax was sent from.   |
| `ApiVersion` <span className="optional-arg">string</span> | The version of the SignalWire API.             |

## Responding to SignalWire

An example of a cXML document that receives an incoming fax:

<Tabs groupId="cxml-api">

<TabItem value="xml" label="XML">

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Receive action="/fax/received"/>
</Response>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
const { RestClient } = require("@signalwire/compatibility-api");
const response = new RestClient.LaML.FaxResponse();

response.receive({ action: "/fax/received" });
console.log(response.toString());
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="csharp" label="C#">

```csharp
using Twilio.TwiML;
using Twilio.TwiML.Fax;
using System;


class Example
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var response = new FaxResponse();
        response.Receive(action: "/fax/received"));

        Console.WriteLine(response.ToString());;
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from signalwire.fax_response import FaxResponse, Receive

response = FaxResponse()
response.receive(action="/fax/received")

print(response)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ruby" label="Ruby">

```ruby
require 'signalwire/sdk'

response = Signalwire::Sdk::FaxResponse.new do |response|
  response.receive(action: "/fax/received")
end

puts response.to_s
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When a fax comes into one of your SignalWire phone numbers, SignalWire makes an HTTP request to the URL endpoint you configured for that number. Your response to that request instructs SignalWire on what to do next.

Responses to the HTTP request are in SignalWire cXML. SignalWire starts at the top of your XML document and executes your commands in order, from top to bottom.

:::info

cXML verbs and their attributes are case-sensitive, so using `<receive>` instead of `<Receive>` will result in an error.

### StatusCallback when sending a fax

When sending a fax you can specify a `StatusCallback` URL. If you do so, your specified URL will receive POST requests with the following parameters:

|                                                         Parameter |                                                                                                     |
