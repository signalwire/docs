This guide demonstrates how to use SignalWire APIs to create a completely functional call center where the features are controlled by the JSON configuration file `config.json` making it **exceedingly** easy to enable/disable features in minutes! The dynamic setup of the JSON menus adds a greater level of customizability to your IVR and makes modifying the structure on the fly a breeze. 

If you'd like to first try out the precursor that this application was built on, check out the guide [here](https://github.com/signalwire/guides/tree/main/Voice/Call%20Center%20with%20Dynamic%20JSON%20Menus%20and%20Python)!

What do I need to Run the Code
------------------------------

You can view or fork the code in our [Github Repo](https://github.com/signalwire/snippets-simple-contact-center) to get going in no time.

This guide uses the Python SignalWire SDK, for a guide on installation click [here](/compatibility-api/sdks).

You will need a SignalWire phone number as well as your API Credentials (API Token, Space URL, and Project ID) which can all be found in an easily copyable format within the API tab of your SignalWire portal.  
<br/>

How to Run the Application
--------------------------

### Build and Run on Docker

1. Build on docker

```
./docker-build
```

2. Run your image

```
docker run --publish 80:80 sw-call-center-demo
```

or if you have docker compose installed, type 

```
docker-compose up
```

or 

```
docker-compose up -d
```

3. The application will run on port 80

<br/>

### Build and Run Natively

1. Edit config.json to build out your contact center.
2. From command line run, python3 app.py

You may need to use an SSH tunnel for testing this code if running on your local machine. â€“ we recommend [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). You can learn more about how to use ngrok [here](/platform/basics/guides/technical-troubleshooting/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok).

Step by Step Code Walkthrough
-----------------------------

Within the Github repository, you will find several files, but we're interested in:

- app.py 
- config.json

<br/>

### Configuring the JSON File

 You can use the settings menu to enable/disable certain features such as waiting music, wait time advertisements or the language/dialect for text to speech. The use of a JSON menu to specify menus, settings, and other instructions is a feature that will save you hours of development time when setting up or customizing your call center!

        ]
      }
    },
```

### Configuring the Python code

We need to start with a little housekeeping by creating an array to store our queues, opening the config.json file so that we can access the values inside, and setting our SignalWire authentication credentials. There are a few additional functions such as `getLogs()`, `cycle_check_thread()`, and `updateLogs()` that we will not review in this writeup but you can read about them in detail through line comments within `app.py`!  
<br/>

```python
# Active Queues Array
ActiveQueues = []

# read menus from json file
with open('config.json') as f:
     ccConfig = json.load(f)
     # Dump config to console, for debugging
     pprint.pprint(ccConfig)

# Set Signalwire Creds from JSON Config 
HOSTNAME = ccConfig['settings']['hostname']
SIGNALWIRE_SPACE = ccConfig['signalwire']['space']
SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT= ccConfig['signalwire']['project']
SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN= ccConfig['signalwire']['token']
```

<br/>

Our first function to define will be `enqueue()` which will use the [Enqueue](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/enqueue) verb to place a caller into a specified queue. We will use the `friendlyName` parameter to indicate the queue and specify additional parameters such as the `action` URL containing instructions for what to do next and the `waitUrl` to play music.
<br/>

```python
def enqueue(queueName, action = HOSTNAME + "/enqueue_event", method = "POST", waitUrl=HOSTNAME + "/wait_music_queue", waitUrlMethod="POST"):
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say("Dialing " + queueName + " one moment please...", voice=ccConfig['settings']['textToSpeech']['voice'])
    response.enqueue(queueName, action=action, method=method, waitUrl=waitUrl, waitUrlMethod=waitUrlMethod)
    print(response)
    # return response
    return response
```

<br/>

Our next function `dial_conference()` will use the [Dial](pathname:///compatibility-api/cxml/voice/dial) verb and the [Conference](pathname:///compatibility-api/cxml/voice/conference-noun) noun to connect an endpoint to a conference using the `friendlyName` parameter and allow to specify additional parameters such as `statusCallbackEvent` or `startConferenceOnEnter`.

<br/>

```python
def dial_conference(conferenceName, muted=False, beep=False, startConferenceOnEnter=True, endConferenceOnExit=False, statusCallbackEvent="start end join leave speaker", statusCallback=HOSTNAME + "/conference_event", statusCallbackMethod="POST"):
    response = VoiceResponse()
    #response.say("Dialing " + conferenceName + " one moment please...", voice=ccConfig['settings']['textToSpeech']['voice'])
    dial = Dial()
    dial.conference(conferenceName, muted=muted, beep=beep, startConferenceOnEnter=startConferenceOnEnter, endConferenceOnExit=endConferenceOnExit, statusCallbackEvent=statusCallbackEvent,statusCallback=statusCallback, statusCallbackMethod=statusCallbackMethod)
    response.append(dial)

    print(response)

    # return response
    return response
```

<br/>

The next function to define is `redirectByRestApi()` which uses the [Update Call API](/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints/update-a-call) to redirect it using the `callSid`. This will merge the caller into the conference with the agent assigned to the caller.

<br/>

```python
def redirectByRestApi(callSid, urlToRedirect):
    client = signalwire_client(SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT, SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN, signalwire_space_url = SIGNALWIRE_SPACE)
    
    # merge the caller into the conference with connect_agent
    caller = client.calls(callSid) \
               .update(
                   url= HOSTNAME + urlToRedirect,
                    method='POST'
                )

    pprint.pprint(caller)
    return "200"
```

<br/>

The next function `connect_agent_ready()` allows us to update a call by queue like in the example above, but you can use a `callSid` or say `Front` to pop the next member in the queue and merge the call. In some cases, you may not have a `callSid`! This function allows the queue to handle the update and get the next caller connected to the agent even without that parameter.  
<br/>

```python
def connect_agent_ready(queueSid, callSidOrFront, agent, channel):
    client = signalwire_client(SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT, SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN, signalwire_space_url = SIGNALWIRE_SPACE)
    
    pprint.pprint(agent)

    # Agent should always connect first, or make the first request 
    # We have an agent ready, willing and able to provide stellar customer service, add agent to conference
    # We use conference, because it gives us more power for later, and advanced features.
    endpoint = agent['channels'][channel]['endpoint']
    call = client.calls.create(
                        url = HOSTNAME + '/connect_agent',
                        to = endpoint,
                        from_ = ccConfig['settings']['outboundPhoneNumber']
                    )

    pprint.pprint(call)

    # merge the caller into the conference with connect_agent
    member = client.queues(queueSid) \
               .members(callSidOrFront) \
               .update(
                   url= HOSTNAME + '/connect_caller',
                    method='POST'
                )

    print(member.call_sid)
    return "200"
```

<br/>
Now that we have displayed all the major conference functionality functions, we will move on to the routes for handling GET or POST requests!  As with the previous section, we will leave out some of the housekeeping routes for clarity but you can view the detailed comments within app.py to learn more about them. 

Our first route `/conference_event` will accept conference events from GET or POST. Within this route we will authenticate the SignalWire Client, look for the last conference participant, and redirect them for post conference using the `redirectByRestApi()` function we defined in the previous section. 

<br/>

```python
@app.route('/conference_event', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def conference_event():
    
    client = signalwire_client(SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT, SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN, signalwire_space_url = SIGNALWIRE_SPACE)
    
    # May optimize later, this will take the last conference participant and redirect them for post conference
    if request.values.get('StatusCallbackEvent') == 'participant-leave':
        participants = client.conferences(request.values.get('ConferenceSid')) \
                     .participants \
                     .list(limit=2)
        for record in participants:
            print(record.call_sid)
            redirectByRestApi(record.call_sid, '/post_conference?fromnumber=' + str(request.values.get('from')))
   
    pprint.pprint(request.values)

    # return response
    return "200"
```

<br/>

The next app route `/wait_music_queue` will generate wait music as well as queue stat updates by utilizing our logger functions. Here we will update the queue logs and then play a message stating the caller's position in the queue, the current size of the queue, and the average queue size. If the `config.json` file has `enableWaitingAds` and `enableWaitingMusic` set to `True` in the `settings` menu, we will play waiting music and ads until the music and ads cycle has completed. At this point, we will redirect back to the same `/wait_music_queue` and increase the count by 1. 

```python
@app.route('/wait_music_queue', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def wait_music_queue():
    count = 0
    if request.values.get('count'):
        count = int(request.values.get('count')) + 1

    response = VoiceResponse()
      
    # Update the queueStats Logs
    updateLogs('queueStats', request.values)

    # Load the queueStatsMessage from config
    queueStatsMessage = ccConfig['settings']['messages']['queueStatsMessage']
    # Replace Template Vars With Values
    queueStatsMessage = queueStatsMessage.replace("%QueuePosition%", str(request.values.get("QueuePosition")))
    queueStatsMessage = queueStatsMessage.replace("%CurrentQueueSize%", str(request.values.get("CurrentQueueSize")))
    queueStatsMessage = queueStatsMessage.replace("%AvgQueueTime%", str(request.values.get("AvgQueueTime")))

    # If enabled play queueStats to caller on hold
    response.say(queueStatsMessage, voice=ccConfig['settings']['textToSpeech']['voice'])

    if ccConfig['settings']['enableWaitingAds']:
        if count < len(ccConfig['settings']['waitingAds']):
            response.play(ccConfig['settings']['waitingAds'][count])
        else:
            count = 0
            response.play(ccConfig['settings']['waitingAds'][count])

    if ccConfig['settings']['enableWaitingMusic']:
        for music in ccConfig['settings']['waitingMusics']:
            response.play(music)

    response.redirect(HOSTNAME + "/wait_music_queue?count=" + str(count), method="POST")
    return str(response)
```

<br/>

The next few routes are quite short and perform very simple functions! `/enqueue_event` and `/voice_event` both exist to update the logs with the correct queue stats and voice stats. The `/inbound_sms` route handles the acceptance of inbound messages but does not respond. 

<br/>

```python
# accepts enqueue events from GET or POST
@app.route('/enqueue_event', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def enqueue_event():
    updateLogs('queueStats', request.values)
    # return response
    return "200"

# accepts voice status events from GET or POST
@app.route('/voice_event', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def voice_event():
    updateLogs('voiceStats', request.values)
    # return response
    return "200"

# accepts sms messages from GET or POST
@app.route('/inbound_sms', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def inbound_sms():
    
    # return response
    return "200"
```

<br/>

The next route `/post_conference` handles what to do with the caller after their call with the agent has ended but before the termination of the call. We will check the `settings` menu in the `config.json` file to see if `enableExitMessage` is set to `True`. If it is, we will play a short exit message for the caller using the verbiage in the menu. If `enableTextSummary` is set to `True`, we will use the [Create Message API](/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints/create-message) to send a message to the caller thanking them for their call. Lastly, we will check if `enableExitSurvey` is enabled. If so, we will redirect to the `/get_survey` route which will be shown below.

<br/>

```python
@app.route('/post_conference', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def post_conference():
    response = VoiceResponse()
    print("kevin here")
    pprint.pprint(request.values)
    # Check if announcment should be played
    if ccConfig['settings']['enableExitMessage']:
        response.say(ccConfig['settings']['messages']['exitMessage'], voice=ccConfig['settings']['textToSpeech']['voice'])

    if ccConfig['settings']['enableExitMessageFile']:
        response.play(ccConfig['settings']['messages']['exitMessageFile'])

    # Send Text Summary Message
    #if ccConfig['settings']['enableTextSummary']:
    #    client = signalwire_client(SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT, SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN, signalwire_space_url = SIGNALWIRE_SPACE)
    #    message = client.messages.create(
    #        body='Thank you for participating in our demo today!',
    #        from_=ccConfig['settings']['outboundPhoneNumber'],
    #        to=request.values.From)
    #    print("message sent: " + message.sid)

    # Check if survey should be enabled
    if ccConfig['settings']['enableExitSurvey']:
        response.say(ccConfig['settings']['messages']['surveyEntryMessage'], voice=ccConfig['settings']['textToSpeech']['voice'])
        response.redirect(HOSTNAME + "/get_survey", Method="POST") 

    return str(response)
```

<br/>

The next route `/enter_queue` is the web entry for entering the queue. The queue name is passed through as a query string variable. If a queue with the specified name doesn't currently exist within our `ActiveQueues` array, we will use [Enqueue](pathname:///compatibility-api/cxml/voice/enqueue) to create one.

<br/>

```python
# Web entry for entering a queue, passing queue name as a querystring var
@app.route('/enter_queue', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def enter_queue():

    #queueInfo = client.queues.create(friendly_name=queue)
    if str(request.values.get("name")) not in ActiveQueues:
        ActiveQueues.append(str(request.values.get("name")))

    response = enqueue( str(request.values.get("name")) )
    # return response
    return str(response)
```

<br/>

The route `/connect_agent` is pretty straightforward - this will accept GET and POST requests in order to connect the agent to the conference with the caller. 

<br/>

```python
@app.route('/connect_agent', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def connect_agent():

    # Logic To Find Best Agent
    response = dial_conference( str(request.values.get("name")) )
    # return response
    return str(response)
```

<br/>

The next route `/connect_caller` is the exact opposite - it will accept GET and POST requests to connect the caller to the conference with the agent!

<br/>

```python
# connects the caller to the conference with agent
@app.route('/connect_caller', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def connect_caller():
    response = dial_conference( str(request.values.get("name")) )
    # return response
    return str(response)
```

<br/>

The next route `/inbound_voice` will handle inbound calls to our phone number. We will first check the `settings` menu to see if `enableRecording` is `True` and then play an entry message for the caller using the verbiage in the `messages` submenu of the `settings` menu. We will check if any announcements should be played and then redirect the main menu of options for the caller to sort through in the `mainMenu` submenu of the `settings` menu in the `config.json` file.

<br/>

```python
@app.route('/inbound_voice', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def inbound_voice():
    response = VoiceResponse()

    # Check if call should be recorded
    if ccConfig['settings']['enableRecording']:
        enableRecording(str(request.values.get('CallSid')))

    response.say(ccConfig['settings']['messages']['entryMessage'], voice=ccConfig['settings']['textToSpeech']['voice'])

    # Check if announcment should be played
    if ccConfig['settings']['enableAnnouncment']:
        response.say(ccConfig['settings']['messages']['announcmentMessage'], voice=ccConfig['settings']['textToSpeech']['voice'])

    # Redirect to the main menu set in config.json
    response.redirect(HOSTNAME + "/get_menu?menu=" + ccConfig['settings']['mainMenu'], method="POST")
    
    # return response
    return str(response)
```

<br/>

The next route `get_menu` dynamically builds the IVR menu tree from the JSON file and uses action routing to continually progress through the various submenus. We will loop through the menus starting at the main menu and ask the user to select input based on the option they'd like to select. After the input has been detected from the caller, we will reroute back to the `/get_menu` route except we will specify the next menu to rotate through. This process will continue until the user has reached an agent or ended the call. 

<br/>

```python
@app.route('/get_menu', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def get_menu():

The last two routes are quite simple! `/get_survey` and `/get_voicemail` are both basic examples of routes that could take a survey after a call has ended or [gather a voicemail ](/voice/getting-started/how-to-set-up-voicemail) when an agent is not available. 

<br/>

```python
# Mock survey rendering for demo 
@app.route('/get_survey', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def get_survey():
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say('This is a survey placeholder...', voice=ccConfig['settings']['textToSpeech']['voice'])
    return str(response)

# Mock voicemail rendering for demo
@app.route('/get_voicemail', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def get_voicemail():
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say('You have reached our voicemail, please leave a message.', voice=ccConfig['settings']['textToSpeech']['voice'])
    response.hangup()
    return str(response)
```

Wrap Up
-------

There are many different methods of building out an IVR, however, when building with a Dynamic JSON menu, the possibilities for customizability increase drastically. Whether you are looking to enable, disable or modify any feature of the IVR, all are achievable with just a couple of curly braces. 

Once our application was running, we used ngrok to obtain a webhook that could be configured to your SignalWire phone number.  And just like that, you now have the most expansive and impressive IVR on your block.
