# Handling Incoming Messages from Code

In [Receiving your first SMS](/messaging/getting-started/receiving-your-first-sms) we
learned how to use Compatibility XML bins to handle incoming messages. In
particular, we showed how to reply with a static message to any incoming SMS.

Handling messages from code gives us more flexibility. Instead of serving a
static XML bin, we can use a custom web server to decide the content of the XML
depending on the incoming message.

In this guide, we will show how to create a simple subscription service: users
will be able to text "START" or "STOP", and we will reply respectively with
"Subscription started!" or "Subscription Stopped".

## Setting up the environment

We are going to use a few libraries to make our job easier. In particular, we'll
need the SignalWire Compatibility SDK and, depending on the language you're
using, we'll also need a web server. Let's install them:

<Tabs groupId="compatibility-api">

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```shell
pip install flask signalwire
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```shell
composer require signalwire-community/signalwire
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```shell
npm install express @signalwire/compatibility-api
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Producing XML

We'd like to set up an endpoint (our own "dynamic" XML bin) which emits an XML document, like this one:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <Message>Subscription started!</Message>
</Response>
```

The XML will be sent back to the client as a response to their request.

In principle, we could manually create such XML by means of string concatenation
or interpolation. However, if you are using one of our supported languages, you
can use our libraries to more easily produce the same XML:

<Tabs groupId="compatibility-api">

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from twilio.twiml.messaging_response import MessagingResponse

response = MessagingResponse()
response.message('Subscription started!')

# Prints the XML string.
print(response.to_xml())
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
use \SignalWire\LaML\MessageResponse;

$response = new MessageResponse;
$response->message('Subscription started!');

# Prints the XML string.
echo $response->asXML();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
import { RestClient } from "@signalwire/compatibility-api";

const response = new RestClient.LaML.MessagingResponse();
response.message("Subscription started!");

// Prints the XML string.
console.log(response.toString());
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Serving the XML

Now that we know how to generate a proper Compatibility XML document, let's see
how to set up a web server to serve those documents.

### Setting up a web server

How you set up the web server is mostly specific to the language and framework
of your choosing. A basic skeleton might be the following:

<Tabs groupId="compatibility-api">

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python title="main.py"
from flask import Flask, request, Response
from twilio.twiml.messaging_response import MessagingResponse

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def message_handler():
    """
    This endpoint will be queried by SignalWire whenever an incoming SMS is received.
    We respond with an XML document which specifies the next instructions.
    """
    print(request.values)
    # The logic goes here
    return
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```php title="index.php"
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
use \SignalWire\LaML\MessageResponse;

# This endpoint will be queried by SignalWire whenever an incoming SMS is received.
# We respond with an XML document which specifies the next instructions.

print_r($_REQUEST);
# The logic goes here
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript title="index.js"
import express from "express";
import { RestClient } from "@signalwire/compatibility-api";

const app = express();
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

/**
 * @param {express.Request} req
 * @param {express.Response} res
 */
function messageHandler(req, res) {
  // This endpoint will be queried by SignalWire whenever an incoming SMS is received.
  // We respond with an XML document which specifies the next instructions.

  /** @type string */
  const body = req.body?.["Body"] ?? req.query?.["Body"];
  console.log(req.body);
  // The logic goes here.
}

app.get("/", messageHandler);
app.post("/", messageHandler);

app.listen(8080);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

In the next section we will configure a phone number so that, when it receives a
message, SignalWire makes an HTTP request to our message handler endpoint. The
HTTP request will contain as parameters values such as the source number or the
body of the incoming message.

For our simple subscription service demo, our message handler needs to look at
the body of the message to determine whether it contains the word "START" or
"STOP". Depending on the word, we will emit an XML document which will produce
different messages.

<Tabs groupId="compatibility-api">

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python title="main.py"
from flask import Flask, request, Response
from twilio.twiml.messaging_response import MessagingResponse

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def message_handler():
    """
    This endpoint will be queried by SignalWire whenever an incoming SMS is received.
    We respond with an XML document which specifies the next instructions.
    """
    print(request.values)

    body = request.values.get('Body')
    if not body:
        return "Invalid parameters."

    response = MessagingResponse()
    if 'START' in body.upper():
        response.message('Subscription started!')
    elif 'STOP' in body.upper():
        response.message('Subscription stopped.')
    else:
        response.message('Message unrecognized. Please text START or STOP.')

    return Response(response.to_xml(), mimetype='text/xml')
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```php title="index.php"
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
use \SignalWire\LaML\MessageResponse;

# This endpoint will be queried by SignalWire whenever an incoming SMS is received.
# We respond with an XML document which specifies the next instructions.

$body = $_REQUEST['Body'] ?? '';
if (empty($body)) {
    echo "Invalid parameters.";
    exit();
}

$response = new MessageResponse;
if (str_contains(strtoupper($body), 'START')) {
    $response->message('Subscription started!');
} else if (str_contains(strtoupper($body), 'STOP')) {
    $response->message('Subscription stopped.');
} else {
    $response->message('Message unrecognized. Please text START or STOP.');
}

header('Content-type: text/xml');
echo $response->asXML();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript title="index.js"
import express from "express";
import { RestClient } from "@signalwire/compatibility-api";

const app = express();
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

/**
 * @param {express.Request} req
 * @param {express.Response} res
 */
function messageHandler(req, res) {
  // This endpoint will be queried by SignalWire whenever an incoming SMS is received.
  // We respond with an XML document which specifies the next instructions.

  /** @type string */
  const body = req.body?.["Body"] ?? req.query?.["Body"];
  if (!body) {
    res.send("Invalid parameters.");
    return;
  }

  const response = new RestClient.LaML.MessagingResponse();
  if (body.toUpperCase().includes("START")) {
    response.message("Subscription started!");
  } else if (body.toUpperCase().includes("STOP")) {
    response.message("Subscription stopped.");
  } else {
    response.message("Message unrecognized. Please text START or STOP.");
  }

  res.set("Content-Type", "text/xml");
  res.send(response.toString());
}

app.get("/", messageHandler);
app.post("/", messageHandler);

app.listen(8080);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This simple message handler works like a dynamic XML bin, whose content depends
on the received message.

Try running the application, which will listen on port 8080:

<Tabs groupId="compatibility-api">

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```bash
python3 -m flask --app main.py run --host='0.0.0.0' --port 8080
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 -v "$PWD":/var/www/html php:8.1-apache
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```bash
node index.js
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Since you are likely behind a NAT, to test this application on your local
machine you need a public IP address that SignalWire can reach. We suggest using
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/): refer to our [guide on ngrok](/platform/basics/guides/technical-troubleshooting/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok)
for more information.

In short, while the application is up and listening on port 8080, run ngrok from a new terminal like this:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

You'll get a public random URL (such as `https://983f-93-41-16-193.ngrok.io/`)
that you can use to access your local application.

### Configuring the number

Now that the code is ready and the HTTP endpoint is reachable from the web, we
need to configure our SignalWire number to access it.

First, we need to create a new cXML script resource that points to your ngrok URL.
To do so, go to the "Resources" section from your sidebar, and create a new Script Resource.
Select the Script type as cXML.

![Script resource selector with cXML highlighted.](@image/dashboard/resources/new-cxml-bin.png)

When configuring the cXML script, select the "External URL" option, and paste the ngrok URL.

![cXML script configuration with external URL](@image/dashboard/resources/external-cxml-bin.png)

import NewLegacy from '/docs/main/_common/dashboard/_ui-accordion.mdx'

<NewLegacy />

If you don't have a phone
number yet, make sure to [buy one](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number). You
will need at least one number to receive messages.

You can do that from the "Phone Numbers" section in the Sidebar. Go to the Settings page of the number you
want to configure. In the `Handling Inbound Messages` section, assign your cXML script.

![Assign Resource](@image/dashboard/phone-numbers/assign-resource-full.png)

<Accordion 
  title="If you're on the Legacy UI"
  defaultOpen={false}
>

You don't need to create a new cXML resource.

Simply open the settings for the number you want to configure, and under "**Inbound Message Settings**", 
choose to handle incoming messages using "LaML Webhooks", then paste the public ngrok URL
which connects to your application. Make sure to **check** the "Use External URL for LaML Webhook handler?" checkbox.

![Legacy UI cXML webhook configuration](@image/dashboard/legacy/external-cxml-webhook-messaging.png)

</Accordion>

Try sending a message to the configured phone number: after a few seconds you'll
receive an automated reply, whose content will be different depending on what
you wrote.

:::info Ensuring message delivery

If you are sending messages to the US from a 10DLC number, you _must_ register
your traffic with the Campaign Registry. Otherwise, the carriers will not
deliver your messages. Please see [**Campaign Registry - Everything You Need To Know**](/messaging/get-started/campaign-registry) for more information.

:::

## Conclusion

We have shown how to handle incoming messages from code, by emitting XML
documents whose content depends on the incoming message. We did all this in the
context of the [Compatibility API](/compatibility-api).

For more advanced, real-time applications, you'll want to check out
our [Realtime SDK](/sdks/realtime-sdk/). Find more details
in the guide about [Sending and Receiving SMS with the Realtime SDK](/sdks/realtime-sdk/guides/messaging/first-steps-with-messaging).
