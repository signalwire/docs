Overview
--------

This application will show how you can use SignalWire and the Python SDK to easily send bulk SMS through a simple script with minimal modifications. This script will read in a CSV of customer data and pull the phone numbers/first names in order to send out messages. When the full send is complete, this script will store the message data in a CSV. 

What do I need to run this code?
--------------------------------


You will need the [SignalWire Python SDK](/compatibility-api/sdks) as well as your authentication variables which can easily be found in the **API** tab of your SignalWire Space.
View [here](/platform/dashboard/get-started/explore#api) to see more about navigating your Space and how to find authentication variables. 

In order to store the message data and export to a CSV, you will need the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library.

```python
import pandas as pd
from signalwire.rest import Client as signalwire_client
import csv
import time

# import client
client = signalwire_client("ProjectID", "AuthToken", signalwire_space_url = 'example.signalwire.com')

# define results dict for storing client records from csv and messages list for storing data about send
results = {}
messages = []

# link placeholder if links need to be sent with the message
# use results[customer] to query database by phone number if customized URLs are needed
smsLink = "https://developer.signalwire.com/"

# read in CSV to dict where phone number is the key and [first name, last name] is the value
with open("src/bulk_sms.csv", 'r', encoding='utf-8-sig') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        results[row['Number']] = [row['First'], row['Last']]
print(results)

# loop through entries and grab first name
for customer in results:
    # store name for matched phone number in variable to use in template
    firstName = (results[str(customer)][0])
    print(f"messaging {firstName}")

    # set formatted number to the E164 version using ternary operator
    formattedNumber = "+" + customer if "+" not in customer else customer

    # send message
    message = client.messages.create(
        from_='+1xxxxxxxxxx',
        body=f"Hello {firstName}, you can access our developer portal at {smsLink} ",
        to=formattedNumber)

    messages.append((message.sid, message.from_, message.to, message.body, message.date_sent))
		# sleep for 1 second in order to rate limit at 1 messag per second - adjust based on your approved campaign throughput
    time.sleep(1)
      
# Puts call log array into dataframe with headers for easier reading.
df = pd.DataFrame(messages, columns=('Sid', 'From', 'To', 'Body', 'Date/Time Sent'))

print(df.to_string)

df.to_csv('BulkSendDetails.csv', index=False, encoding='utf-8')
```

Step by Step Code Content
-------------------------

### Customer Data CSV

The first thing you will need is a CSV with customer data in the format of first name, last name, and phone number, like shown below: 

```text
First,Last,Number
Eleanor,Shellstrop,+1xxxxxxxxxx
Chidi,Anagonye,1xxxxxxxxxx
Tahani,Al-Jamil,1xxxxxxxxxx
Jason,Mendoza,1xxxxxxxxxx
```

The correct country code must be included for the number to be routed correctly. You can find the correct code by country [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes). 

### main.py

 The first step for using any of our Compatibility APIs is to import the SignalWire library and authenticate the client. We will also import `pandas` and `csv` here. 

```python
import pandas as pd
from signalwire.rest import Client as signalwire_client
import csv
import time

# import client
client = signalwire_client("ProjectID", "AuthToken", signalwire_space_url = 'example.signalwire.com')
```

In the next step, we define a dictionary `results` to store customer data and a `messages` list for storing each message record sent. We will open the CSV (make sure to correct the path in your code) and read each file into our `results` dictionary using the phone number as the key and the first name/last name as the value.

If your messaging needs a link, you can use the `smsLink` variable to point to it or point to the dynamically generated URL through a query to your database.

```python
# define results dict for storing client records from csv and messages list for storing data about send
results = {}
messages = []

# read in CSV to dict where phone number is the key and [first name, last name] is the value
with open("src/bulk_sms.csv", 'r', encoding='utf-8-sig') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        results[row['Number']] = [row['First'], row['Last']]
print(results)

# link placeholder if links need to be sent with the message
# use results[customer] to query database by phone number if customized URLs are needed
smsLink = "https://example.com/"
```

Our next section will loop through each of the `results` customers and store the first name and formatted phone number into variables. If the original number is not in E164 format (including the + in front of the country code), we will assign the E164 version to the `formattedNumber` variable. We will then send the message and append the message data to the `messages` array. If you do not need a link, change the template to not include `smsLink`. 

```python
# loop through entries and grab first name
for customer in results:
    # store name for matched phone number in variable to use in template
    firstName = (results[str(customer)][0])
    print(f"messaging {firstName}")

    # set formatted number to the E164 version using ternary operator
    formattedNumber = "+" + customer if "+" not in customer else customer

    # send message
    message = client.messages.create(
        from_='+1xxxxxxxxxx',
        body=f"Hello {firstName}, you can access our developer portal at {smsLink} ",
        to=formattedNumber)

    messages.append((message.sid, message.from_, message.to, message.body, message.date_sent))
# sleep for 1 second in order to rate limit at 1 messag per second - adjust based on your approved campaign throughput
    time.sleep(1)

```

Lastly, now that the bulk send is over, we will store the `messages` data in a pandas dataframe and export to CSV. 

```python
# Puts call log array into dataframe with headers for easier reading.
df = pd.DataFrame(messages, columns=('Sid', 'From', 'To', 'Body', 'Date/Time Sent'))

print(df.to_string)

df.to_csv('BulkSendDetails.csv', index=False, encoding='utf-8')
```
