# Reply Statistics

This guide will use the SignalWire Python SDK to get a list of owned DIDs, and compare inbound and outbound messages to provide statistics on reply rate.

</figure>

## What do I need to run this?

You will only need the [SignalWire Python SDK](/compatibility-api/sdks), and your SignalWire API credentials. If you aren't sure where to find your credentials, check out [this](/platform/dashboard/get-started/explore) guide on naviating your Space.

## How do I run this code?

```python
from signalwire.rest import Client as signalwire_client

SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT_KEY =
SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN = 
SIGNALWIRE_SPACE = 
client = signalwire_client(SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT_KEY, SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN, signalwire_space_url=SIGNALWIRE_SPACE)

replydict={}
uniquereplies=[]
ournumbers=[]
badsmsbody=["STOP","NO","UNSUBSCRIBE"]
badsmsnumbers=[]
sentmsgscount = 0

response = client.incoming_phone_numbers.list()
for sid in response:
    ournumbers.append(sid.phone_number)

response = client.messages.list()
for message in response:
    if message.from_ in ournumbers:
        sentmsgscount = sentmsgscount+1
    if message.body in badsmsbody:
        badsmsnumbers.append(message.from_)
    if message.from_ not in ournumbers and message.to in ournumbers:
        if message.body not in badsmsbody and message.from_ not in uniquereplies:
            uniquereplies.append(message.from_)
        replydict[message.sid] = [message.from_,message.body]

replycount = len(replydict)
uniquecount = len(uniquereplies)
badcount = len(badsmsnumbers)
replypercent = (replycount/sentmsgscount)*100
sentmsgscount = str(sentmsgscount)

print ("You sent "+str(sentmsgscount)+ " messages")
print("You recieved " + str(replycount) + " Replies")
print(str(uniquecount) + " Unique User Replied")
print(str(badcount)+ " Stop or other bad replies")
print("Your reply rate is " + str(replypercent)+ "%")
```

</details>

### Run Natively

Run the app.py file in your python environment of choice.

## Code Walkthrough

The only file for this snippet will be an `app.py` file.

### Into our application

#### Setup

First we will import our SignalWire python SDK to handle our requests to SignalWire.

```python
from signalwire.rest import Client as signalwire_client
```

Now we can use our SignalWire credentials to create a `client`

```python
client = signalwire_client(SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT_KEY, SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN, signalwire_space_url=SIGNALWIRE_SPACE)
```

Setting up our lists and dictionary variables for later use.

`replydict` will take each message with the message SID as the key, and the message `from_` and `body` as a list of values.

`uniqureplies` will be our filtered "good" replies list

`ournumbers` will pull numbers from our project. this could be replaced with a list of phone numbers from a campaign to create a more granular overview of an account with multiple campaigns.

`badsmsbody` is our list of "bad" words, these could be opt-out phrases, or any other replies you do not want to consider useful to count in your statistics

`badsmsnumbers` is a list of the phone numbers who have sent "bad" replies.

`sentmsgcount` will count the the outbound messages sent from `ournumbers`

```python
replydict={}
uniquereplies=[]
ournumbers=[]
badsmsbody=["STOP","NO","UNSUBSCRIBE"]
badsmsnumbers=[]
sentmsgscount = 0
```

#### List ournumbers

Now that we are done with our setup we can begin by populating our list of phone numbers.

```python
response = client.incoming_phone_numbers.list()
for sid in response:
    ournumbers.append(sid.phone_number)
```

#### List messages

Then we can call a list of all messages. You could filter these messages by passing arguments to `client.messages.list()`.

For each message we get from this call, we will check if the message is from one of `ournumbers`  
and increment `sentmsgscount`

Then we will check the message body and append bad messages to our `badsmsnumbers` list.

Then, if the message is not from `ournumbers`, and is to `ournumbers`. We ensure that the message is not "bad", and is a unique entry to our `uniquereplies` list.  
Additionally we will add all replies regardless of if they are unique to our `replydict`.

```python
response = client.messages.list()
for message in response:
    if message.from_ in ournumbers:
        sentmsgscount = sentmsgscount+1
    if message.body in badsmsbody and message.from_ not in ournumbers:
        badsmsnumbers.append(message.from_)
    if message.from_ not in ournumbers and message.to in ournumbers:
        if message.body not in badsmsbody and message.from_ not in uniquereplies:
            uniquereplies.append(message.from_)
        replydict[message.sid] = [message.from_,message.body]
```

#### Data formatting

Finally, we will do some calculations, and format our data so it can be printed to the console.

```python
replycount = len(replydict)
uniquecount = len(uniquereplies)
badcount = len(badsmsnumbers)
replypercent = (replycount/sentmsgscount)*100
sentmsgscount = str(sentmsgscount)

print ("You sent "+str(sentmsgscount)+ " messages")
print("You recieved " + str(replycount) + " Replies")
print(str(uniquecount) + " Unique User Replied")
print(str(badcount)+ " Stop or other bad replies")
print("Your reply rate is " + str(replypercent)+ "%")
```

An example of output would be printed to the console like so:

```output
You sent 60 messages
You recieved 11 Replies
1 Unique User Replied
0 Stop or other bad replies
Your reply rate is 18.333333333333332%
```

## Wrapup

This guide provides a basic application to gather statistics on sms replies using the SignalWire python SDK. While this is a basic implementation it can be a powerful tool to implement into more in-depth reporting systems for your SignalWire usage.
