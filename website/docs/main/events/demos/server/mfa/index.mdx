# Multi-Factor Authentication Digital Employee

<div class="row">
    
    <div class="col col--6">

    In today's digital age, security is paramount. 
    As we navigate through the vast expanse of online platforms, the need for robust security measures has never been more crucial. 
    
    This is where **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** comes into play, adding an extra layer of security
    by requiring users to verify verify a 6-digit token sent to one of their devices prior to access.

    On this page, you'll find a full breakdown of the prompts used, along with all the functions. The functions are written in Perl. To quickly access all relevant files, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/signalwire/digital_employees/tree/main/server/Perl_Examples/MFA).

## **The Role of `send_mfa` Function**

The `send_mfa` function is a crucial component in the MFA process, designed to send a 6-digit token to the user via text message. 
This function is part of a Perl script that interfaces with SignalWire's REST API, leveraging its capabilities to enhance user security through MFA.

### **The Workflow**

At its core, the function operates within a web application framework, extracting necessary information from incoming requests and utilizing SignalWire's messaging platform to dispatch the MFA token. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: The script begins by initializing necessary components and decoding incoming request data to extract the user's phone number and other relevant information.

2. **SignalWire REST API Setup**: It then sets up the SignalWire REST API with necessary credentials, including the account SID, auth token, and the Space URL.

3. **Sending the SMS**: With everything in place, the script crafts an HTTP POST request to SignalWire's MFA endpoint. This request includes the user's phone number, the sender's number, and parameters specifying the token's length, validity period, and maximum attempt count.

4. **Handling the Response**: Upon receiving the response from SignalWire, the script decodes it to determine the outcome. If successful, it sends a confirmation back to the user, indicating that the 6-digit number has been sent. In case of failure, it notifies the user to try again.

5. **Broadcasting the Outcome**: Throughout the process, the script also broadcasts updates to a specified agent ID, ensuring transparency and traceability of the MFA request's status.

### **Code Snippet Analysis**

The Perl script showcases the practical implementation of the `send_mfa` function, from initializing the web application components to sending the SMS and handling the response. Notable aspects include:

- **Use of SignalWire::ML and SignalWire::RestAPI**: These modules facilitate interaction with SignalWire's messaging and REST API, enabling the script to send SMS messages and handle responses effectively.

- **Dynamic Response Handling**: The script dynamically adjusts the response based on the success or failure of the SMS sending operation, providing clear feedback to the user.

- **Security and Flexibility**: Parameters like `token_length`, `valid_for`, and `max_attempts` add layers of security and flexibility, allowing for customization based on specific requirements.

## **The Role of `verify_mfa` Function**

The `verify_mfa` function is designed to validate a token previously sent to the user. This step is crucial in the MFA sequence, acting as the final gatekeeper before granting access. Verification ensures that the user not only possesses the correct credentials but also holds the token sent to their device, adding an extra layer of security.

### **How It Works**

The Perl script snippet provided gives us insight into how the `verify_mfa` function operates within a web application. Here's a breakdown of its key components and workflow:

1. **Initialization**: The script sets the stage by initializing essential components and parsing the incoming request to extract the token and other necessary data.

2. **Setting Up the SignalWire REST API**: It then prepares the SignalWire REST API for interaction, configuring it with the account SID, auth token, and Space URL.

3. **Token Verification Request**: With the API ready, the script sends a POST request to verify the token. This is the heart of the `verify_mfa` function, where the token provided by the user is checked against the one stored or expected by the system.

4. **Response Handling**: After the verification request, the script processes the response. If the token is valid, it confirms the verification success; otherwise, it signals a failure.

5. **Broadcasting the Outcome**: Throughout the process, updates are broadcasted to an agent ID, ensuring transparency and allowing for real-time tracking of the verification process.

### **Code Exploration**

The provided Perl code illustrates the practical application of the `verify_mfa` function, showcasing the seamless integration of MFA verification into a web application's authentication flow. 

Key points include:

- **Use of SignalWire::ML and SignalWire::RestAPI Modules**: These modules facilitate the script's communication with SignalWire's REST API, enabling efficient token verification.

- **Dynamic Response Processing**: The script adeptly handles the verification response, adjusting its actions based on the outcome to provide immediate feedback.

- **Enhanced Security Measures**: By verifying tokens through a secure API call, the `verify_mfa` function reinforces the security of the authentication process, ensuring only verified users proceed.
