# Base URL

Each Space on SignalWire gets its own subdomain and each Space will have its own URLs for accessing the REST API.

All calls in the provided examples use the `demo` subdomain; however, please note that the **actual base URL** you will use will differ for each Space, since it will be customized to include your unique Space name.

For your own custom URL, replace `demo` with your unique subdomain.


```shell
https://demo.signalwire.com
```
