SignalWire REST APIs support two authentication methods: **Basic Authentication** and **Bearer Authentication**.
Each endpoint specifies which method it accepts.

## Basic Authentication

[Basic Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/basic-authentication/) 
is the standard method for authenticating with SignalWire REST APIs, using your **Project ID** and **API Token**.

### How it works

Include an `Authorization` header with each request:

```
Authorization: Basic <credentials>
```

To build the `credentials` string:

1. Join your Project ID and API Token with a colon: `ProjectID:APIToken`
2. [Base64](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64) encode the result

#### Example

Given the Project ID `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890` and API Token `4tjCGnmAeQ0hwFmFDhwfgww880X2lsnuR60VMyasGR3hFpSyvu`:

```bash
# In the format username:password
a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890:4tjCGnmAeQ0hwFmFDhwfgww880X2lsnuR60VMyasGR3hFpSyvu

# Base64 encoded:
YTFiMmMzZDQtZTVmNi03ODkwLWFiY2QtZWYxMjM0NTY3ODkwOjR0akNHbm1BZVEwaHdGbUZEaHdmZ3d3ODgwWDJsc251UjYwVk15YXNHUjNoRnBTeXZ1

# Full header:
Authorization: Basic YTFiMmMzZDQtZTVmNi03ODkwLWFiY2QtZWYxMjM0NTY3ODkwOjR0akNHbm1BZVEwaHdGbUZEaHdmZ3d3ODgwWDJsc251UjYwVk15YXNHUjNoRnBTeXZ1
```

### Finding your credentials

Your Project ID and API Tokens are available in the 
[SignalWire Dashboard](/platform/dashboard/getting-started/your-signalwire-api-space).

</Frame>

### API token scopes

Tokens can be scoped to limit API access. 
Select scopes when creating or editing a token in the Dashboard.

Getting a `401 Unauthorized`? 
Check that your token has the required scope. 
Manage scopes in the [SignalWire Dashboard](/platform/dashboard/getting-started/your-signalwire-api-space).

### cURL examples

```bash title="cURL"
# With base64-encoded credentials
curl https://{Your_Space_Name}.signalwire.com/api/calling/calls \
     -H 'Authorization: Basic YTFiMmMzZDQtZTVmNi03ODkwLWFiY2QtZWYxMjM0NTY3ODkwOlBUOWE4YjdjNmQ1ZTRmM2EyYjFj'

# Encoded inline using the Bash pipe operator
curl https://{Your_Space_Name}.signalwire.com/api/calling/calls \
    -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "YourProjectId:YourApiToken" | base64)" 

# Encoded inline with cURL's -u flag
curl https://{Your_Space_Name}.signalwire.com/api/calling/calls \
    -u YourProjectId:YourApiToken

```

## Bearer Authentication

[Bearer Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/bearer-authentication/) passes a token in the `Authorization` header. Use this for client-side calls where you can't safely expose your API credentials.

### How it works

Include the token in an `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Bearer tokens are short-lived and scoped to specific permissions, unlike API credentials which don't expire.

### Token types

#### Subscriber Access Token (SAT)

SATs authenticate end users in Fabric applications, letting client apps make API calls on behalf of a subscriber.

**How to obtain:** Call the [Create Subscriber Token](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/fabric/subscriber-tokens-create) endpoint using Basic Auth.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-space.signalwire.com/api/fabric/subscribers/tokens \
     -H 'Authorization: Basic <Base64(YourProjectID:YourAPIToken)>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "reference": "user@example.com",
       "expire_at": 1725513600
     }'
```

**Use case:** Client apps connecting to Fabric services, such as listing [Fabric Addresses](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/fabric/fabric-addresses-list).

#### Guest Token

Guest Tokens grant limited, temporary access without full subscriber privileges. They're created from an existing SAT and restricted to specific Fabric addresses.

**How to obtain:** Call the [Create Subscriber Guest Token](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/fabric/guest-tokens-create) endpoint using a SAT.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-space.signalwire.com/api/fabric/guests/tokens \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <subscriber_access_token>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "allowed_addresses": ["c22d24f6-5a26-4f53-8008-b29530339efa"]
     }'
```

**Use case:** Click-to-call widgets, guest access, or anywhere you need temporary access.

### Token lifecycle

Bearer tokens expire. Once they do, requests return `401 Unauthorized` and you'll need a fresh token.

To keep a session alive without re-authenticating, call the [Refresh Subscriber Token](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/fabric/refresh-tokens-create) endpoint before expiration.

### cURL example

```bash title="cURL"
curl https://your-space.signalwire.com/api/fabric/addresses \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

With a SAT token:

```bash title="cURL"
curl https://your-space.signalwire.com/api/fabric/addresses \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMjU2R0NNIiwiY2giOiJwdWMuc2lnbmFsd2lyZS5jb20iLCJ0eXAiOiJTQVQifQ...'
```

## Security best practices

1. **Keep API credentials server-side.** Use Bearer tokens for client applications.
2. **Set short token lifetimes** to reduce risk if a token leaks.
3. **Scope tokens narrowly**—only grant what's needed.
4. **Always use HTTPS.** Plain HTTP requests will fail.
5. **Rotate API tokens periodically** from your Dashboard.
