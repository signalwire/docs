# Paging

Most top-level API resources support bulk fetching via a list or index method.
These list endpoints share a common structure to make handling lists, filtering
and pagination easier to work with.

All list endpoints will return partial "pages" of results. These results will
also contain meta information about how to get the next page of results, or the
previous one, or return to the start.

It is **_highly recommended_** to use the `link` values to navigate your list
results. This will ensure you properly page through all of resources and your
result set is not affected by new resources being created, or paging scheme
changing.

**An example of the paging information returned for all index routes.**

```json
{
  "links": {
    "self": "/api/relay/rest/example_url_to_the_current_page",
    "first": "/api/relay/rest/example_url_to_the_first_page",
    "next": "/api/relay/rest/example_url_to_the_next_page",
    "prev": "/api/relay/rest/example_url_to_the_prev_page"
  },
  "data" : [
    { ... },
    { ... }
  ]
}
```
