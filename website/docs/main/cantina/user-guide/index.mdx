# User Guide for SignalWire Work/Events

### Guide for User's Features

### 1. Login to SignalWire:

End-users who landed on the login page by entering the SignalWire Work Url (ex. `<https://abcd.sw.work>`) 
in the browser will have two options on this screen to join the portal:

- **Registered User:** 
Registered users have a designated login ID and password on their SignalWire instance and are able to be put into groups. 
Registered Users have the same permissions as guests, plus screen sharing. 
This User Type can log in by clicking "Join as Registered User" and entering the username and password given to them by their administrator.

Registered users can be assigned various roles by the administrator user by making changes in the configurations at the User level, Global level, or Room level.

- **Guest User:** Any user who joins the room using an invitation link without creating an account in the system is called a Guest user. Guests don't need to log in and can enter SignalWire simply by entering their name and email address. Guests have the least permissions of all the user types. Guests are able to use basic functionalities such as audio and video muting, using the chat, switching rooms in the room navigator. Guests are only able to share screens when given access by the moderator.

To Login into this system, the user will first have to enter their 'Email Address'.
If the entered Email ID is registered in the system, the user will have the following option on the screen:

### 2. Home Screen:

In this system, visitors or registered users can view multiple conference rooms and their previews from the home screen. 
Multiple options are present on this screen based on the User's roles and rights.

The Home Screen allows Users to see the activity in each room through room previews. 
Room previews show the name of the room, a list of who is currently participating, and a short video clip of the participants who are currently in the conference. 
The user having an Administrator role can view all of the following options:

\*2.1 List view and Grid view of the Conference rooms:\*\*

List of all the Permanent rooms created by various members will be listed here in the List view, and in the grid view those rooms will be displayed as medium-sized icons with the following details:

- Name of the room
- Room Description (If any)
- Image configured for the room when any conference is not going on
- Image configured for the room when some conference is going on
- Preview of the Ongoing call
- Names of the users who joined the call (in case of the ongoing call)

- Option to Join the room.
- Buttons Created by the user for that room (with URL attached)

**2.2 Find or Create room:**

Here in the search box, the user can enter the name of the Room to search for the room, if any room with that name exists, then that room's icon will be displayed.

And if any room with that name does not exist, then an option to 'Create a new room' will be displayed and the user can create a new permanent room with the entered name from there.

**2.3 Room Dialer:**

The user can use this feature for creating auto-created rooms. 
The user can enter the name of the room to search for the room, if any room with that name exists then that room will be dialed and the user will enter that room.

But if any room with the entered room name does not exist then a temporary room (Auto-created room) will be created and the user will enter that room. 
The auto-created room remains in the list only until the call lasts, once the call is completed that room will also end.

If the name or number of a private conference room is known, it can be called in by using the dialer at the top of the page. 
When joining a conference from a direct link, the Home Screen will be bypassed and participants automatically added to the call.

**Calls:** This option displays the call history of the logged-in User.

**2.4 Help:** The users can take help from the Signal Wire using this feature. 
The help panel will appear on the left-hand side of the screen where they can search for knowledge articles or start a text chat.

### 3. How to join the room:

To join a SignalWire room for the first time, a participant may have been given one or more of the following:

**1. SignalWire domain and room name**

- Domain: abcd.sw.work
- Room name: example-room

**2. Full SignalWire room URL**  
`<https://abcd.sw.work/>`

**3. A telephone number for voice-only participants**

**4. Security PIN**

- Guest PIN
- Moderator PIN

**5. OR Registered Email ID and Password to join as a registered user.**

Further Process:

- To join SignalWire, enter the SignalWire domain or full room URL in the browser address bar. 
As a first-time user, SignalWire will prompt for name and email address.

- Enter the full name and email address to be shared with other conference participants. 
This information will be used for the banner (also known as a "lower-third" among media professionals) that is displayed with the video feed or avatar during conferences.

- After entering full name and email address information (and upon joining a room), SignalWire will prompt for granting permissions to the browser. 
As SignalWire uses the device's camera and microphone to participate in conferences, the browser permissions will need to be granted for both.

- To set up the avatar image for your account: SignalWire uses gravatar.com to display a custom image when you mute your video feed during a conference. 
Navigate to gravatar.com, sign up for an account, and use the email address that will be displayed in SignalWire to set up the avatar.

### 8.4 Operating/Security Settings

**1. Webcam Anti-Virus Issues**

When using SignalWire work in Chrome, you may experience being denied. 
Your system's anti-virus could be blocking devices and software from accessing the internet. 
Access settings for the anti-virus software will need to be modified to stop blocking the webcam.

Use the link below according to your anti-virus software to update the settings:

[**Norton** ](https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v126148153)

**2. Default Ports**

Depending on your company infrastructure, you might have to make firewall adjustments to have a successful experience with SignalWire Work.

When a company implements a "block all except allowed IPs/ports" firewall implementation this is pretty common and most cloud applications function the same.

Below is a listing of the default ports :

**TCP**

- 80
- 443
- 1935
- 5443

**UDP**

- 10000 - 15000
- 49000 - 54000

The IP to allow is the IP that resolves to your Space URL.

Windows Example: nslookup hq.sw.work resolves to 3.135.218.58

It's not recommended to pin your firewall rule to the IP address because it can change periodically. 
If pinning the IPs is necessary you'll have to check periodically that it has not changed.

### 8.5 Audio

**1. Identifying Audio Quality Issues**

SignalWire Work users can experience various audio issues. 
The information listed below will help to identify the audio issues experienced, with descriptions and possible explanations.

```
Click on the noise or sound problem to hear a sample recording of each.
```

**Noise **- Any noise on the line or in a voicemail message in addition to the voice signal. 
Noise typically leaves the conversation intelligible but still far from excellent. 
Static, hum, crosstalk, and intermittent popping tones are examples where the calling and called parties can understand each other but with some effort. 
Some noises are so severe that the voice becomes unintelligible. 
One such example, among the samples provided in this document, is a motor sound.

**Absolute Silence**

- Symptom - the experience of not knowing whether the other person is still there because there is no sound on the line
- Cause - Voice Activity Detection (VAD) without comfort noise. 
The background noise is loud enough for the silence insertion to be noticeable but soft enough so that VAD is engaged.

**Clicking**

- Symptom - an external sound similar to a knock that is inserted usually at intervals.
- Cause - clock slips or other digital errors are common causes

**Crackling**

- Symptom - an irregular form of very light static, similar to the sound a fire makes
- Cause - poor electrical connections, in particular poor cable connections. 
Other causes are electrical interference and a defective power supply on the phone

**Crosstalk**

- Symptom - where you can hear another conversation on the line; other parties cannot hear you; also forms where all parties can hear each other
- Cause - wires in close proximity, where the signal of one is inducted into the other.

**Hissing/Hissing w/Unintelligible Voice Symptom Recording/Hissing Periods**

- Symptom - more driven and constant than static; white noise is often associated with strong hissing; pink noise is less constant hissing noise and brown noise even less constant still/a driven white noise that overwhelms the voice/periods often occur between segments of speech rather than throughout the whole signal
- Cause - Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

**Hum**

- Symptom - a buzzing noise of interference from an electromagnetic source (ex. sound heard on the radio when a nearby mobile phone is to be called or detecting a cell.)
- Cause - an electromagnetic source or telephone cables run near power lines

**Popping**

- Symptom - external sounds that are broader and less regular than clicking; similar to popping sounds heard on a two-way radio
- Cause - a Cisco Unity NIC card problem that inserts extra popping sounds

**Motor Sound**

- Symptom - a severe distortion or a loud, rough, beating sound
- Cause - fast switched cRTP bug

**Screeching**

- Cause - Digital Signal Processor (DSP) bug or failure

**Static/ Severe Static**

- Symptom - granular distortion similar to bad reception on the radio
- Cause - electrical interference or Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

**Echoed Voice** - when the voice signal is repeated on the line and can be heard at either end of the call, in varying degrees & w/ many combinations of delay and loss within the echoed signal.

**Listener Echo**

- Symptom - sounds similar to talker echo but the signal strength might be lower; the component of the talker echo that leaks through near-end hybrid and returns again to the listener, which causes a delayed softer echo; the listener hears the talker twice
- Cause - insufficient loss of the echo signal; long echo tail; echo cancellers in the gateway adjacent to the near-end hybrid not activating

**Talker Echo**

- Symptom - the signal which leaks in the far-end hybrid not activating and returns to the sender (talker); the talker hears an echo of their voice
- Cause - insufficient loss of the echo signal; echo cancellers in the gateway adjacent to the far-end not activating; acoustic echo caused by the phone of the listener

**Tunnel Echo**

- Symptom - similar to talking in a tunnel or on a poor quality mobile phone car kit
- Cause - tight echo with some loss; ex. 10 ms delay and 50% loss on the echo signal

**Garbled Voice**- where the actual character of the voice is altered to a significant degree and often has a quality that fluctuates. Sometimes, the voice becomes unintelligible.

**Choppy Voice (Broken Voice)**

- Symptom - the sound when there are gaps in the voice; syllables appear to be dropped or badly delayed in a start and stop fashion
- Cause - consecutive packets that are lost or excessively delayed, such that DSP predictive insertion cannot be used and silence is inserted instead (ex. delay inserted into a call through contention caused by large data packets

**Clipped Voice**

- Symptom - where words are cut off; it can occur at the front-end or tail-end of a word; sometimes it occurs at the beginning of a sentence
- Cause - Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

**Robotic Voice**

- Symptom - a special case of synthetic voice
- Cause - the default playout delay was small enough to mean that jitter induced by Cisco Unity caused packets to be dropped and predictive insertion to occur

**Synthetic Voice**

- Symptom - the sound of the voice is artificial and with a quiver of fuzz; predictive insertion causes this sound by replacing the sound lost when a packet is dropped with the best guess from a previous sample; commonly occurs w/ choppy voice
- Cause - single packet loss or delay beyond the bound of the de-jitter buffer playout period; DSP predictive insertion causes the synthetic quality of the voice (ex. when a call is provided insufficient bandwidth)

**Underwater Voice/Intelligible Underwater Voice / Unintelligible Underwater Voice**

- Symptom - voice problem similar to the sound of your voice when heard underwater/describes a distortion that makes it impossible to understand the voice; descriptions are the sound of a cassette tape fast-forwarded, a gulping sound, and a wishy-washy sound/
- Cause - a fast-switched cRTP bug

**Quack**

**Volume Distortion -** associated with incorrect volume levels, whether constant or in flux.

**Fluctuating Voice**

- Symptom - when the volume of the voice increases & decreases in a wave fashion; if occurs rapidly it can be confused with some form of garbled voice
- Cause - a bug w/ IP telephone load

**Fuzzy Voice**

- Symptom - sounds similar to a radio turned up too loud and the voice is shaky; this might only occur at certain signal levels within the sentence; this depends on the level of gain applied
- Cause - too much gain on the signal, possibly introduced at one of a number of points in the network (ex. the signal can be overdriven from the PBX of high gain through the Cisco Unity Tag-switched Path (TSP) setting

**Loud Voice**

- Cause - too much gain on the signal, possibly introduced at one of a number of points in the network (ex. the signal can be overdriven from the PBX or high gain through Cisco Unity TSP setting

**Muffled Voice**

- Symptom - sounds similar to when you speak w/ your hand over your mouth
- Cause - overdriven signal or some other cause that eliminates or reduces signal level at frequencies inside the key range for voice

**Soft Voice**

- Cause - too much attenuation on signal possibly introduced at one of a number of points in the network.

**Tinny Voice**

- Symptom - similar to when you listen to an old-fashioned wireless broadcast
- Cause - an overdriven signal, or some other cause that eliminates or reduces

Information is taken from [here](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/voice/voice-quality/30141-symptoms.html).

**2. Using AirPods with SignalWire Work and SignalWire Events**

When using Apple AirPods with SignalWire Work or SignalWire Events you may experience metallic and distorted audio quality (if power is lost or are deliberately turned off). 
This is because Apple doesn't refresh or load the next default audio input/output devices unless the browser is refreshed. 
A quick refresh of the browser will resolve the issue and reconnect to the call.

### 8.6 Video

**Screen Sharing Looping**

When sharing your screen in SignalWire work using certain browsers, using your Entire Screen option can result in an inception look or a looping effect of your screen.

![The screen sharing menu showing options to share your entire screen, application window, or a Chrome tab.](@image/cantina/af217d9-pic22.webp "The screen sharing menu showing options to share your entire screen, application window, or a Chrome tab.")

![An infinite mirror effect caused by recursive screen sharing.](@image/cantina/d100d71-pic23.webp "An infinite mirror effect caused by recursive screen sharing.")

This occurs when you share a screen that displays what you plan on sharing it will show itself, like holding two mirrors against each other. 
While this may cause you to think it's a bug, it's normal behavior.

To resolve this, select Application Window or Chrome Tab instead of Your Entire Screen. Using one of those options will avoid the looping effect.
