# Administrator Guide for SignalWire Work/Events


### Getting started with an Administrator account

An Administrator holds the right to manage Global system settings, including user accounts, user groups, recordings to ClipEEze, and set room level settings.

### **1. Global Tab**

This section covers the guidelines on how to configure room security, visibility, and its global impact on rooms and home screens. Administrators can set default settings for all the rooms from the ‘Global’ tab. However, individual rooms can modify them from room settings, with the Administrator having complete control to change them.

### 1.1 Security

This section covers security aspects of the rooms/participants to join events, like verification by visitor/guest user PIN, moderator PIN, and presence of moderators. The individual room can adjust their room settings, overriding global level predefined settings.

- PIN- Administrators can set a unique PIN for guests or invited users to authenticate their room entry. Without entering the PIN, the user will not be able to enter the room. This security will be applicable for preconfigured rooms & auto-created rooms.

- Moderator PIN- Administrators can set a PIN for the user to enter a specific room with Moderator’s permission from this tab. It can be set on all the pre-configured rooms or auto-created rooms.

- Require Moderator- The administrator can manage the settings for participants to speak by ticking or unticking the "Require Moderator" box. If enabled, then other participants (visitor/guest) can not speak internally in the absence of a moderator. These settings can be applied for temporary as well as permanent rooms.

### 1.2 Options

This section covers room-level settings such as auto end, clipeeze, and other configurations.

- Auto End- The system ends a conference call automatically when a single participant remains in a  
  running conference. However, these settings can be overridden by the Rooms configuration.

- Allow ClipEEze- It determines whether participants can play ClipEEze at the conference. However,  
  these settings can be overridden by the Rooms configuration.

- Warn before joining- The system will notify current participants when a new participant enters the room with a sound. However, these settings can be overridden by the Rooms configuration.

- Disable Chat-The chat button and window will be hidden from all users, including Administrators.

- One Way Chat- Moderator, can chat with multiple guest users individually. However, one guest user  
  will not be able to chat or view the chat of another guest user.

- Guests have Visitor Access to Auto Created Rooms- When this option is enabled, the guests will get  
  access to the auto-created rooms.

- Banner Display options- Administrators can select what details of the participant are to be displayed on the banner, such as name, email, or company name. User can select from the below 3 options:

  ```
      Show Nothing: Will only display the participant's names.
      Email Address: Will display the participant's name and email address.
      Company Name: Will display the participant's name and company name.
  ```

### 1.3 Advance Options

And at the bottom screen, all audiences will be equally divided with no role.

- Karaoke Audience- It will display the main performer with an audience in the rest of the screen to fit the canvas’s size where performer guests will have performer roles and anchors have special guest 1 and sp2 roles. So, sp1 and sp2 will be highlighted in corners among the rest of the audience.

- Round Table- Moderator needs to select 8 participants and give them guest roles 1 to 8 with the main center focus role to the 9th participant in the call. So the screen will be divided into nine boxes, and one main speaker will be visible in the center of the screen.

- Screen Share - Moderator will select the following role from layout roles. The chosen role will be reflected on the screen with a shared screen in the middle/center screen. 4 speakers will be highlighted big or small at the left and right corners.

  4. Top left
  5. Bot right
  6. Bot left
  7. Big top right
  8. Big top left
  9. Big bot right
  10. Big bot left
  11. Video clips
  12. Fullscreen

- Screen Share (Split horizontal)- Shared screen and the presenter will be visible in canvas with one by default and screen role. The presenter will have one guest role. So the shared screen will be utilized max, and the speaker can be highlighted during the call.

- Stage Audience - Screen will be visible with the main speaker highlighted in the center screen with a special guest’s side beside the presenter, and the audience will be visible in the rest of the screen.

- Stage Audience Top - It will display video in large at the top of the screen, and the audience will be fitted in the rest of the screen covering the main screen so the maximum audience.

- Stage X 2 Audience- It will display the main speaker with a top and bottom of the screen with a larger view surrounded with the audience (left and right side) on the screen, so there will be 2 screen stages that will be highlighted during the call.

- Stage X 3 Audience- It will display the main speaker with a larger view and 3rd speaker with a source surrounded with the audience on the screen, so there will be three screen stages that will be highlighted during the call.

- Watch Party- It will display video in large in the center of the screen, and the audience will be fitted in the ¾ of the screen covering the main screen so the maximum audience can be covered, and a center screen will be highlighted with video content. Therefore, the moderator needs to select the main content participant as visible in the center from the layout role.

- Watch Party (large)- It will display video zoomed in the center of the screen, and the audience will be fitted in the rest of the screen covering the main screen so the maximum audience can be covered, and a center screen will be highlighted with video content. Here moderators can assign special guest roles that will be visible in a left corner among the audience. In addition, moderators can select big screen participants who will have a max view on the center screen.
