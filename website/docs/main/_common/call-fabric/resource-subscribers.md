    Subscribers are a special type of Resource that represent internal account-holders.
    
    Subscribers always use the `private` context by default, though `public` Aliases can be added.

    Subscribers can receive or initiate calls, messages, and other forms of interaction.
    
    The SignalWire platform facilitates smooth transitions between different communication modes,
    such as switching from a voice call to a video conference, or from a text chat to a voice call.
