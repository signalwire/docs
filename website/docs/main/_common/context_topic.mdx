    **What is a context?** Â 

    Contexts are used to segregate messages and calls. If you
    associate a group of phone numbers to context A and a different group of numbers to
    context B, then from your code you can decide whether to receive events (such as
    incoming calls or messages) only for the numbers in A, only for the numbers in B, or
    for both. We are going to use "office" in this guide, but you can pick any name.
