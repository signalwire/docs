# Quickstart

<Subtitle>Deploy your first SWML script in 5 minutes</Subtitle>

This guide will walk you through deploying your first SWML script to handle incoming calls. By the end of this quickstart, you'll have a working phone number that runs your SWML application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A [SignalWire account](https://signalwire.com/signups/new)
- Our ready to deploy [SWML script](#example-script-to-get-started) (or use your own)

## Deploy your SWML script

<Steps>

### Step 1: Access SignalWire dashboard
Go to [my.signalwire.com](https://my.signalwire.com?page=relay-bins).

### Step 2: Create new script
Click Script, then SWML script to open the New SWML Script dialogue box. Paste the Script in the Primary Script field, then select create.

### Step 3: Script location
Your script will be saved in the "My resources" section under "Scripts". It will remain housed here under the name you provide for easy reference.

### Step 4: Assign a phone number
1. Navigate to **Phone Numbers** in your Dashboard
2. Purchase a phone number if needed by clicking the "+ New" button in the top right hand corner of the page
3. Click on your phone number, then click "Edit Settings"
4. Click on "+ Assign Resource", then assign your SWML Script.

### Step 5: Test your application
Call your assigned phone number to test your SWML application.

You can write and save new SWML scripts from the "Relay/SWML" section of your Dashboard.
In that section, switch to the tab named [SWML Scripts](https://my.signalwire.com/relay-bins).
Once there, you can create a new SWML script:

<figure>
  <img
    alt="SignalWire Dashboard with SWML tab open"
    className="img-600"
    src={require("./new-swml-2.png").default}
  />
</figure>

After you save the SWML, navigate to the [Phone Numbers](https://my.signalwire.com/phone_numbers) page.
Open the settings for a phone number you own (you may have to buy a new one),
and configure it to handle incoming calls using the SWML script you just saved.

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-400"
    alt="SignalWire Dashboard's phone number setting screen, selecting a SWML script as call handler."
    src={require("./add-phone-number.png").default}
  />
</figure>

</Accordion>

## Example script to get started

If you don't have a SWML script already prepared, here's a simple example you can use:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - play:
        url: "say:Hello World!"
    - play:
        url: "say:Congratulations on successfully deploying your script!"
    - hangup: {}
```

This script will:
1. Answer the incoming call
2. Play a welcome message using text-to-speech
3. Play a congratulations message
4. Hang up the call
