# Quickstart

<Subtitle>Deploy your first SWML script in 5 minutes</Subtitle>

This guide will walk you through deploying your first SWML script to handle incoming calls. By the end of this quickstart, you'll have a working phone number that runs your SWML application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A [SignalWire account](https://signalwire.com/signups/new)
- A SWML script ready for deployment

## Deploy your SWML script

<Steps>

### Access SignalWire dashboard
Go to [my.signalwire.com](https://my.signalwire.com?page=relay-bins).

### Create new script
Click Script, then SWML script to open the New SWML Script dialog box. 
Paste your SWML Script into the Primary Script field, then select create.

If necessary, copy and paste the below example script:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - play:
        url: "say:Hello World!"
    - play:
        url: "say:Congratulations on successfully deploying your script!"
    - hangup: {}
```

Your script will be saved in the "My resources" section under "Scripts". 
It will remain housed here under the name you provide for easy reference.

### Assign a phone number
- Navigate to **Phone Numbers** in your Dashboard
- Purchase a phone number if needed by clicking the "+ New" button in the top right hand corner of the page
- Click on your phone number, then click "Edit Settings"
- Click on "+ Assign Resource", then assign your SWML Script.

### Test your application
Call your assigned phone number to test your SWML application.

You can write and save new SWML scripts from the "Relay/SWML" section of your Dashboard.
In that section, switch to the tab named [SWML Scripts](https://my.signalwire.com/relay-bins).
Once there, you can create a new SWML script:

<figure>
  <img
    alt="SignalWire Dashboard with SWML tab open"
    className="img-600"
    src={require("./new-swml-2.png").default}
  />
</figure>

After you save the SWML, navigate to the [Phone Numbers](https://my.signalwire.com/phone_numbers) page.
Open the settings for a phone number you own (you may have to buy a new one),
and configure it to handle incoming calls using the SWML script you just saved.

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-400"
    alt="SignalWire Dashboard's phone number setting screen, selecting a SWML script as call handler."
    src={require("./add-phone-number.png").default}
  />
</figure>

</Accordion>
