# SWML

<Subtitle>SignalWire Markup Language</Subtitle><br/>

## Introduction

SignalWire Markup Language (SWML) lets you write Relay applications using simple statements in a YAML or a JSON document.
[Relay applications](/sdks/overview/what-is-relay)
are programs connected to the SignalWire network through a real-time WebSocket connection.
They can dynamically and interactively use the services offered by SignalWire, including
[**voice calls**](/voice),
[**video conferences**](/video),
[**messaging**](/messaging) and
[**chat**](/chat).

SWML also allows you to instantiate
[**AI agents**](/ai/get-started).
AI Agents hold natural conversations with the caller, and perform actions intuitively based on the resources you have specified
(like REST API endpoints or SWAIG functions).

On your SignalWire Dashboard, you can configure SMWL scripts to be executed in response to a phone call,
through a Relay script, or when a subscriber calls a SWML resource.
You can write and store SWML on the SignalWire Dashboard, but you can also serve SWML scripts directly from a web server.
You can even respond with dynamically generated SWML scripts.

## SWML and Resource Addresses

SWML is the best-supported way to use the new Call Fabric paradigm.
To access a Resource, simply reference its Address using this syntax:

```text
space_name.signalwire.com/context/address
```

Each **Resource Address** has two components:

- **Context**: A identifier that indicates the container in which a Resource is located.
- **Name**: The name is the unique identifier for the resource.

For example, the address for a `Subscribers` resource named `Alice` in the `public` context would be `/public/Alice`.

Learn more by reading our
[Introduction to Call Fabric](/platform/call-fabric)
or the guide to
[Managing Resources](/platform/call-fabric/resources).

## Writing SWML

SWML documents are written in YAML or its equivalent JSON.
The following SWML script will answer a call, play some music, then hang up:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - execute:
        dest: play_music
        params:
          to_play: 'https://cdn.signalwire.com/swml/April_Kisses.mp3'
  play_music:
    - play:
        url: '%{params.to_play}'
```



Let us walk through the components of this script.

### `version`

Every SWML script starts with a version string.
Version `1.0.0` is the latest, and the only supported version.

### `sections`

Each SWML script is divided into sections, which are arrays of statements and methods to execute.
Methods that don't expect parameters are be mentioned as strings (like [`answer`](/swml/methods/answer)).
Methods with parameters are invoked as objects
(like [`execute`](/swml/methods/execute) and [`play`](/swml/methods/play)).

Every SWML script must have the `main` section, which is where execution starts.
You can switch to other sections by using either the [`execute`](/swml/methods/execute) method
or the [`transfer`](/swml/methods/transfer) method.
Sections behave like functions when you invoke them with the [`execute`](/swml/methods/execute) method,
but when you invoke a section using [`transfer`](/swml/methods/transfer),
control is transferred to the new section and doesn't return.

In the example above, we have two sections: `main` and `play_music`.
The `main` section first answers the call.
Then it executes the `play_music` section which calls the [`play`](/swml/methods/play) method.

### Variable substitution and expression evaluation

Anything inside a `%{ }` bracket is considered a JavaScript expression.
This can be used to insert variables in SWML.
In the example, params passed through the [`execute`](/swml/methods/execute) method are accessed by`%{params.to_play}`.
If we wanted to lowercase the URL, we could have written `%{params.to_play.toLowerCase()}`.

### AI in SWML

You can use the [AI methods](/swml/methods/ai) to very quickly create flexible
AI agents.

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - ai:
        post_prompt_url: https://example.com/my-api
        prompt:
          text: |
            You are Franklin's assistant, and your job is to collect messages for him over the phone.
            You can reassure that Franklin will get in touch as soon as possible.
            Collect the user's name and number if you do not already know it from the caller id.
            Start by presenting yourself, then let the contact know that Franklin is not available, then offer to collect a message.
            After collecting the message, do not wait for the user to end the conversation: say good bye and hang up the call.
        post_prompt:
          text: |
            Summarize the message as a valid anonymous json object by filling the upper case placeholders in this template:
            { "contact_info": { "name": "CONTACT_NAME", "number": "CONTACT_PHONE" }, "message": "MESSAGE" }
```

In this example, we instantiate an AI agent with instructions to get messages from the caller.
Once the call ends, the `post_prompt` text will summarize the conversation and HTTP POST it to the `post_prompt_url`.

## Serving SWML

### From the Dashboard

:::tip

This use case is described in detail in the 
[Making and Receiving Phone Calls](/voice/getting-started/making-and-receiving-phone-calls) guide.

:::

<Steps>

#### Open the Resources tab

<AddResource/>

#### Create a new SWML Script

From within the Resources tab, click **Add New** and select **SWML Script**.

#### Save the SWML Script

Input your SWML and save.

</Steps>

##### In the Legacy Dashboard {#legacy-dashboard}

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion 
  title="In the Legacy Dashboard"
  description="Follow these instructions if your SignalWire Space is on the Legacy Dashboard"
>

You can write and save new SWML scripts from the "Relay/SWML" section of your Dashboard.
In that section, switch to the tab named [SWML Scripts](https://my.signalwire.com/relay-bins).
Once there, you can create a new SWML script:

<figure>
  <img
    alt="SignalWire Dashboard with SWML tab open"
    className="img-600"
    src={require("./new-swml-2.png").default}
  />
</figure>

After you save the SWML, navigate to the [Phone Numbers](https://my.signalwire.com/phone_numbers) page.
Open the settings for a phone number you own (you may have to buy a new one),
and configure it to handle incoming calls using the SWML script you just saved.

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-400"
    alt="SignalWire Dashboard's phone number setting screen, selecting a SWML script as call handler."
    src={require("./add-phone-number.png").default}
  />
</figure>

</Accordion>

<UiAccordion/>

</AccordionGroup>

### From a web server

:::tip

This use case is described in detail in the [Handling Incoming Calls from Code](/swml/guides/remote_server) guide.

:::

In the phone number settings, when you check the "Use External URL for SWML Script handler?" option,
you can set a Web URL that will serve the SWML script.
Every time a call comes in (or some other designated event occurs),
you'll get a HTTP POST request to the URL with the following JSON parameters:

| Parameter | Type                              | Description                                                                                                |
| --------: | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    `call` | [`Call`](#the-call-object) object | Contains properties describing the call.                                                                   |
|    `vars` | `any` object                      | Contains the list of variables set in the calling SWML. Empty when invoked as a direct response to a call. |
|  `params` | `any` object                      | Contains the list of params set by the calling SWML. Empty when invoked as a direct response to a call.    |

The following is an example JSON that you might receive as a POST request on your server when a SWML is requested.

```json
{
  "call": {
    "call_id": "<CALL_UUID>",
    "node_id": "<NODE_ID>",
    "segment_id": "<SEGMENT_ID>",
    "call_state": "created",
    "direction": "inbound",
    "type": "phone",
    "from": "<CALLING PHONE NUMBER>",
    "to": "<THE NUMBER ATTACHED TO THE SWML>",
    "from_number": "<CALLING PHONE NUMBER>",
    "to_number": "<NUMBER ATTACHED TO THE SWML>",
    "headers": [],
    "project_id": "<YOUR PROJECT ID>",
    "space_id": "<YOUR SPACE ID>"
  },
  "vars": {}
}
```

#### The Call Object

The `call` object is a description of the received call.
It will have the following properties:

|       Parameter | Type       | Description                                                             |
|----------------:|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       `call_id` | `string`   | A unique identifier for the call.                                       |
|       `node_id` | `string`   | A unique identifier for the node handling the call.                     |
|    `segment_id` | `string`   | A unique identifier for the segment.                                    |
|    `call_state` | `string`   | The current state of the call.                                          |
|     `direction` | `string`   | The direction of this call. <br/>Possible values: `inbound`, `outbound` |
|          `type` | `string`   | The type of call. <br/>Possible values: `sip`, `phone`                  |
|          `from` | `string`   | The number/URI that initiated this call.                                |
|            `to` | `string`   | The number/URI of the destination of this call.                         |
|       `headers` | `object[]` | The headers associated with this call.                                  |
|  `headers.name` | `string`   | The name of the header.                                                 |
| `headers.value` | `string`   | The value of the header.                                                |
|    `project_id` | `string`   | The Project ID this call belongs to.                                    |
|      `space_id` | `string`   | The Space ID this call belongs to.                                      |

The `vars` object and the `params` object will be empty for a new call.
If you're executing a remote SWML script using the [`execute`](/swml/methods/execute) or [`transfer`](/swml/methods/execute) methods,
the `vars` parameter has a list of the variables declared in the script so far.
And the `params` object has the list of parameters explicitly set by the [`execute`](/swml/methods/execute) or [`transfer`](/swml/methods/execute) methods.

You can also reference the properties of `call` and `params` objects during the script execution using the variable subtitution bracket like so:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - play:
        url: 'say:%{call.from}'
```

Further, consider the following SWML script:

```yaml andJson
# hosted on https://example.com/swml.yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - play:
        url: '%{params.file}'
    - return: 1

```

It references `params.file` in it's [`play`](/swml/methods/play) method.
If this SWML was invoked as a response to a phone call, it would cause an error as the `params` object is empty.
But if it was hosted on a server and called with the [`execute`](/swml/methods/execute) or the [`transfer`](/swml/methods/transfer) method,
the `params` object is passed into the SWML.

The SWML above can be invoked as follows:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    execute:
      dest: https://example.com/swml.yaml
      params:
        file: https://cdn.signalwire.com/swml/audio.mp3
```

### From a Relay application

You can also execute SWML from a Relay application.
The following is an snippet using the [RealTime API](/sdks/realtime-sdk).

```javascript
const { Voice } = require("@signalwire/realtime-api");
const script = `
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - execute:
        dest: play_music
        params:
          to_play: 'https://cdn.signalwire.com/swml/April_Kisses.mp3'
  play_music:
    - play:
        url: '%{params.to_play}'
`;

const client = new Voice.Client({
  project: "<your project token>",
  token: "<your project API key>",
  topics: ["swml"],
});

client.on("call.received", async (call) => {
  try {
    await client.execute({
      method: "calling.transfer",
      params: {
        node_id: call.nodeId,
        call_id: call.callId,
        dest: script,
      },
    });
  } catch (error) {}
});
```

In this snippet, we are registering an event for every time a call is received to any phone number in your project with the topic "swml".
You can set the topics a number is subscribed to from the phone number settings page in the SignalWire Dashboard.
Every time a call is received, the SWML script is executed using the `client.execute` method.
