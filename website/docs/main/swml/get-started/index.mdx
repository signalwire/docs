# SWML

<Subtitle>Build powerful communication applications with the SignalWire Markup Language</Subtitle>

***

## Introduction

SWML is a markup and scripting language for quickly writing powerful communication applications in YAML or JSON documents. SWML is easy to use, can be deployed with our without additional infrastructure like your own server, and enables you to create powerful voice and messaging applications using a descriptive format. Whether you're building simple call forwarding systems or complex AI-powered customer service agents, SWML provides the tools you need to deploy sophisticated communication workflows. 

### SWML Strengths

- **Server or Serverless**: Serve SWML from your own server or via the SignalWire platform
- **Powerful**: Handle voice calls, messaging, AI agents, and more
- **Simple**: Descriptive format that's easy to learn and maintain

## Core concepts

### Document structure

Every SWML script follows this basic structure in either YAML or JSON format:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - method1: {}
    - method2:
        parameter: value
```

| Properties | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `version` | Always use `1.0.0` (the only supported version) |
| `sections` | Contains all script sections |
| `main` | Required starting section where execution begins |


### Sections

Sections are named blocks of code that organize your script. Every script starts with `main` as your entry point, but you can create additional sections for different tasks (like `sales`, `support`, `menu`). To move between sections:

- **execute**: Calls a section like a function and returns to the current section
- **transfer**: Transfers control permanently to another section

### Methods

Methods are the commands that tell SWML what to do during a call - like answering, playing audio, or collecting input. Think of them as the instructions in your script. See our full list [here](/swml/methods) for more information and a detailed overview

## Basic SWML examples

Here are some basic SWML examples utilizing these core concepts for Text to Speech and Call Forwarding:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="text-to-speech" label="Text to Speech">

Create a simple text-to-speech greeting:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - play:
        url: "say:Hello from Signal Wire! Have a great day!"
    - hangup
```

This script will answer the incoming call, play a greeting message using text-to-speech, and then hang up.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="call-forwarding" label="Call Forwarding">

Forward incoming calls to another number:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - connect:
        to: "+18888888888"
```

This script will forward the incoming call to the specified phone number.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## IVR creation with SWML

An Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system routes callers to different departments based on their input. This example demonstrates a complete IVR that answers the call, plays a welcome message, records the conversation, collects user input (via keypress or speech), and routes callers to sales or support. This pattern is one of the most common use cases for SWML and demonstrates how multiple methods work together to create a professional phone system.

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - play:
        url: "say:Welcome to Acme Corporation. This call may be recorded."
    - record_call:
        stereo: true
        format: wav
    - prompt:
        play: "say:Press 1 for sales, Press 2 for support"
        max_digits: 1
        speech_hints:
          - one
          - two
    - switch:
        variable: prompt_value
        case:
          '1':
            - execute:
                dest: sales
          '2':
            - execute:
                dest: support
          one:
            - execute:
                dest: sales
          two:
            - execute:
                dest: support
        default:
          - execute:
              dest: sales
  sales:
    - play:
        url: "say:You have reached sales"
    - connect:
        to: "+15551234567"
  support:
    - play:
        url: "say:You have reached support"
    - connect:
        to: "+15551234568"
```

> **Variable substitution**: Notice how `prompt_value` in the switch statement automatically contains the user's input from the prompt. SWML supports dynamic values using the `%{variable_name}` format. For example, you can reference call information with `%{call.from}` or parameters with `%{params.audio_file}`.
