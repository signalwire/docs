# Creating an IVR with SWML

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to build a Simple IVR (Interactive Voice Response) using SWML (SignalWire Markup Language). 
SWML enables you to create RELAY applications using a descriptive format without the need for additional infrastructure like your own server.

## Getting started

Before proceeding ahead with this tutorial, you should be familiar with the [Making and Receiving Phone Calls](/voice/getting-started/making-and-receiving-phone-calls#swml) guide. 
This resource will offer you step-by-step instructions on how to create a SWML script directly on your [SignalWire SWML Dashboard](https://my.signalwire.com?page=relay-bins).

The first crucial step is to have a SignalWire Space. Begin by [signing up now to get started](https://signalwire.com/signups/new).

In this guide we will create an IVR with SWML that takes a prompt from the user and directs callers to the appropriate resource.

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - play:
        urls:
          - >-
            say:Welcome to the Vance Refrigerator Corporation. For Quality
            assurance this call maybe recorded
    - record_call:
        stereo: true
        format: wav
    - prompt:
        play: >-

          talk to a Customer Representative
        say_language: en-US
        max_digits: 1
        speech_hints:
          - one
          - two
          - three
    - switch:
        variable: prompt_value
        case:
          '1':
            - execute:
                dest: sales
          '2':
            - execute:
                dest: support
          '3':
            - execute:
                dest: customer
          one:
            - execute:
                dest: sales
          two:
            - execute:
                dest: support
          three:
            - execute:
                dest: customer
        default:
          - execute:
              dest: sales
  sales:
    - play:
        url: 'say:You have reached sales'
    - connect:
        to: +1XXXXXXXXXX
  support:
    - play:
        url: 'say:You have reached support'
    - connect:
        to: +1YYYYYYYYYY
  customer:
    - play:
        url: 'say:You have reached a Customer representative'
    - connect:
        to: +1ZZZZZZZZZZ
```

To put this script into action right away, simply copy it into a [new SWML script](https://my.signalwire.com?page=relay-bins/new), 
replace placeholders with your information, and save it with a descriptive name so you can assign a phone number to run it.

Below, we will dissect each section and method of this script to gain a clear understanding of its purpose and functionality.

### Sections

Each SWML script comprises a "sections" field, which serves as a mapping of named sections for execution. 
The initial execution always begins with the "main" section. 
It is essential to include a "main" section in the document at all times.

Firstly, we "answer" the call. 
Then, we proceed by using the [`play`](/swml/methods/play) method to welcome our customer and provide them with a simple menu to choose from. 
Afterward, we initiate the call recording using [`record_call`](/swml/methods/record_call).

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - play:
        urls:
          - >-
            say:Welcome to the Vance Refrigerator Corporation. For Quality
            assurance this call maybe recorded
    - record_call:
        stereo: true
        format: wav
```

### Gather Input

Still in the "main" section, we use the [`prompt`](/swml/methods/prompt) method to collect digits from the end user: 
`1` for Sales, `2` for Support and `3` for a Customer representative.

```yaml andJson
- prompt:
    play: >-
      say:Press 1 to talk to sales, Press 2 to talk to Support, Press 3 to talk
      to a Customer Representative
    say_language: en-US
    max_digits: 1
    speech_hints:
      - one
      - two
      - three
```

### Conditional Handling

SWML provides you with ability to use conditional statements with the result from `prompt`. 
In this final part of the "main" section, we use [`switch`](/swml/methods/switch) to direct a caller to Sales in the case of a response of 1, Support for a response of 2, and a connects to a representative in the case of a response of 3. 
Within each switch case, we use the [`execute`](/swml/methods/execute) method to execute another section of our script.

```yaml andJson
- switch:
    variable: prompt_value
    case:
      '1':
        - execute:
            dest: sales
      '2':
        - execute:
            dest: support
      '3':
        - execute:
            dest: customer
      one:
        - execute:
            dest: sales
      two:
        - execute:
            dest: support
      three:
        - execute:
            dest: customer
    default:
      - execute:
          dest: sales
```

### Connecting Call

After the user makes a selection, they are directed to dedicated sections **sales**, **support**, or **customer**, triggering an outbound call to the corresponding department or agent. 
This seamless integration is achieved through the [`connect`](/swml/methods/connect) method, where the "to" parameter is the department or agent's phone number. 
You will want to either replace these values in your script or add environmental variables.

```yaml andJson
sales:
  - play:
      url: say:You have reached sales
  - connect:
      to: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
support:
  - play:
      url: say:You have reached support
  - connect:
      to: "+1YYYYYYYYYY"
customer:
  - play:
      url: say:You have reached a Customer representative
  - connect:
      to: "+1ZZZZZZZZZZ"
```

### Testing

To put our creation to the test, make sure your script is saved to your Resource, or your SWML scripts with a recognizable name. 
Then we'll purchase a phone number from our [SignalWire Space](https://my.signalwire.com?page=phone_numbers/new) to run it. 
Follow the [Buying a Phone Number](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number) if you need help.
Once you have your phone number, we can assign our newly crafted SWML Script resource to handle incoming calls for that number.

![Assign resource to phone number](@image/dashboard/phone-numbers/assign-resource-voice.webp)

Upon calling the assigned phone number, our script will execute, and you should hear the instructions running as intended. 
This exciting step will allow us to experience firsthand the interactive capabilities of our SWML-based IVR system.
