Let us take a deep dive into the [`request`] method. Using this method, you can send HTTP requests to
a web server open to internet. It is a simple but powerful way to add all kinds of external functionality to
SWML scripts.

:::tip Reference available

This is a guide for the [`request`] method.
The reference for this method can be found in [here][`request`].

We will start by pulling a random dad joke from the internet and reading it out loud to the user.

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - play:
        url: 'say:Hello! I can tell you a random dad joke. Please wait a moment.'
    - request:
        url: 'https://icanhazdadjoke.com/'
        method: GET
        headers:
          Accept: application/json
        save_variables: true
    - play:
        url: 'say:%{request_response.joke}'
    - hangup: {}
```

The following points should be noted:

1.  After [`answer`]ing the phone call and [`play`]ing a short welcome message, we request
    a joke from the website [icanhazdadjoke.com](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/).

2.  We specifically state that we want the response to be in JSON format using the [`Accept`] header.

3.  We have set the `save_variables` option to be `true`. SWML can parse the JSON response for you and save all
    the response objects into a variable named `request_response`.
4.  The server gives back a JSON object in the form:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "HlGlbFdiqjb",
      "joke": "Why don't eggs tell jokes? They'd crack each other up",
      "status": 200
    }
    ```

    We read aloud the `joke` property of the response JSON using the [`play`] method.

## Sending POST request

Let us send some information to the server using a POST request.

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - prompt:
        play: 'say: Enter PIN'
        max_digits: 4
        terminators: '#'
    - request:
        url: 'https://reqres.in/api/users'
        method: POST
        save_variables: true
        body:
          pin: '%{prompt_value}'
    - play:
        url: 'say:Pin set to: %{request_response.pin}'
    - hangup: {}
```

## Using your own server

So far, we have used publicly available test REST API. You can also write your own web server, and
interact with that using the [`request`] method.

An example server in Flask (Python) and Express (Node.js) is presented below:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python/Flask">

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from waitress import serve

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=['POST'])
def swml():
    body = request.get_json(silent=True)
    print(body)

    # TODO: process body
    result = body
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    serve(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=6000)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript/Express">

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

// note the POST method
app.post("/", (req, res) => {
  const body = req.body;
  console.log(body);
  // TODO: process body
  const result = body;
  res.json(result);
});

const port = 6000;
app.listen(port);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

If you need help opening up this web server from your localhost to the wider internet where SWML
execution system can find it, please follow this [ngrok guide].

:::

Once this web server is up, you can write SWML to access this service.

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - prompt:
        play: 'say: Enter PIN'
        max_digits: 4
        terminators: '#'
    - request:
        url: 'https://<uuid>.ngrok-free.dev'
        method: POST
        save_variables: true
        body:
          pin: '%{prompt_value}'
    - play:
        url: 'say:Pin set to: %{request_response.pin}'
    - hangup: {}
```
