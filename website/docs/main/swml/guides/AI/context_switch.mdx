# Using `context_switch`

In this example, we will demonstrate how to use `context_switch` to shift the focus of the conversation.
The AI agent will switch between a `StarWars` and `StarTrek` context. While in a context,
the AI agents name and purpose will change, and the AI agent will only be able to answer questions
related to the context.

## **Initial Prompt**

:::caution
Providing too much information in the initial prompt can cause the AI agent to get confused
during a context switch. It is recommended to keep the initial prompt short and simple. Try to
only provide information that is necessary for the AI agent to perform proper context switching.
:::

In our initial prompt, we will declare the AI as a multi-personality bot, and explain to the AI
its name and purpose will change depending on the context. We will also explain that the user can
change the topic of conversation by using the `swap_topics` function. This function will be used
to switch between the `StarWars` and `StarTrek` contexts. Finally, we will set some boundaries for the AI
by declaring it supports two valid contexts, `StarWars` and `StarTrek`.

After this is all declared, we will instruct the AI agent to use the `swap_topics` function to switch to the `StarWars` context.
This will cause the AI agent to start the call in the `StarWars` context.

```yaml andJson
sections:
  main:
    - ai:
        prompt:
          text: |
            You are a multi-personality bot.
            You support two valid contexts. 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek.'
            The context dictates your name and purpose.
            If the user asks about changing topics, use the `swap_topics` function.

            To begin, use the 'swap_topics` function to switch to 'Star Wars'.
```

## **Context Switching**

In this example, we will use the `swap_topics` function to switch between the `StarWars` and `StarTrek` contexts.
The `swap_topics` function will take in a `topic` argument, which will be used to determine which context to switch to.
The `topic` argument will be used to match against the `pattern` in the `data_map.expressions` array. If a match is found,
the `output.action` will be executed. If no match is found, we will fall back to the `".*"` expression, which will inform the user
that the intended context switch was unsuccessful and will end the call.

**Example Function**:

```yaml andJson
- function: swap_topics
  purpose: To change topics.
  argument:
    type: object
    properties:
      topic:
        type: string
        description: The topic being changed to.
  data_map:
    expressions:
      - string: '%{lc:args.topic}'
        pattern: /trek/i
        output:
          response: OK
          action:
            - say: Let me find someone who can help you with StarTrek. Please
                hold.
            - context_switch: ...
      - string: '%{lc:args.topic}'
        pattern: /wars/i
        output:
          response: OK
          action:
            - say: Let me find someone who can help you with StarWars. Please
                hold.
            - context_switch: ...
      - string: .*
        pattern: .*
        output:
          response: OK
          action:
            - say: "I'm sorry, I was unable to change topics to %{input.args.topic}. End call."
            - stop: true
```

### Context Switching Options

In the `data_map.expressions.output.action` array, we will use the `context_switch` action to switch our current context of the AI.
The `context_switch` action will take in a `system_prompt`, `user_prompt`, and a `consolidate` parameter.

- **`system_prompt`** will be the new prompt for the AI agent to use, in other-words its new `context`.
- **`user_prompt`** will be used as user input. It will tell the AI agent that it wants to talk about the new context.
- **`consolidate`** will guide the AI agent's behavior regarding the integration of contexts.
  When set to `true`, the AI agent combines the previous context with the new one. If false, only the new context is considered.

## **StarWars Context**

In the `StarWars` context, the AI agent will be named `Luke`. The AI agent will only be able to answer questions related to `StarWars`.
The `user_prompt` argument is set to `I want to talk about StarWars`. This will be used as user input.
The `consolidate` argument is set to `false`, so the AI agent will only use the new prompt.

### Example

```yaml andJson
- context_switch:
    system_prompt: |
      Your name is Luke. You are a bot that knows only about StarWars.
      ## Handling the user
      - Greet the user, introduce yourself and mention you are a StarWars expert.
      - Help answer any questions the user has about StarWars to the best of your ability.
    user_prompt: I want to talk about StarWars.
    consolidate: false
```

## **StarTrek Context**

In the `StarTrek` context, the AI agent will be named `Leonard`. The AI agent will only be able to answer questions related to `StarTrek`.
The `user_prompt` argument is set to `I want to talk about StarTrek`. This will be used as user input.
The `consolidate` argument is set to `false`, so the AI agent will only use the new prompt.

### Example

```yaml andJson
- context_switch:
    system_prompt: |
      Your name is Leonard. You are a bot that knows only about StarTrek.
      ## Handling the user
      - Greet the user, introduce yourself and mention you are a StarTrek expert.
      - Help answer any questions the user has about StarTrek to the best of your ability.
    user_prompt: I want to talk about StarTrek.
    consolidate: false
```

## **Final Example**

:::caution
It's important to remember the boundaries of the AI agent that you have set in the initial prompt, and in the new context.
If a user asks a question about StarTrek while in the StarWars context, the AI agent will not be able to answer the question.
The user will need to switch to the StarTrek context before asking the question.
