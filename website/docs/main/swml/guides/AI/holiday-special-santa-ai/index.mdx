# Creating a Santa AI with SWML: Engaging in the Spirit of Christmas

## **Prerequisites**
* A SignalWire account ([sign up](https://signalwire.com/signup) for free!)
* A SignalWire phone number ([buy a number](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number) if you don't have one)
* Real-Time Amazon Data API ([subscribe](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-amazon-data/) to the API)

## **Overview**
Join SignalWire in getting into the spirit of Christmas with an innovative, serverless, and seasonal application of our new AI Agents!
Today we'll build a Santa AI designed to interact with users on the phone and inquire about their Christmas wishes using the powerful
and flexible [SignalWire Markup Language (SWML)](/swml).


The Santa AI we'll build together communicates with users over the phone in spoken natural language, powered by OpenAI and Eleven Labs'
Text-To-Speech engine, to determine what they want for Christmas. Santa then uses the Real-Time Amazon Data API to search for the
top three gifts based on their wishes. Once the user chooses their favorite gift, the Santa AI sends an SMS to the user
with a link to the chosen gift.

This helps to create a magical and interactive experience for children, allowing them to communicate their Christmas
wishes in a fun and engaging way. It also helps to ease the gift-buying process for parents, as they can get a better
idea of what their child wants for Christmas, and then purchase the gift directly from Amazon.

## **Setup**

To get our AI Santa set up, we will take the following steps:

1. Sign into your SignalWire Space and navigate to your Dashboard.
2. Create a new Relay (SWML) Script using the sample script and provided instructions.
3. Assign a phone number to the Relay (SWML) Script.

We'll explain each of these steps in detail throughout the article. Follow along, and don't
hesitate to reach out if you have questions or run into issues!

## **The Santa AI SWML Breakdown**

### The AI Section
The heart of our Santa AI lies in its AI section. Here, specific parameters like `prompt`, `post_prompt_url`
`params`, `languages`, and `SWAIG` (SignalWire AI Gateway) are defined. These parameters are critical to the Santa AI experience, as they
define the AI's personality, languages, and capabilities.


```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        ...
      post_prompt_url: Put Your Personal Post Prompt Webhook Here
      params:
        ...
      languages:
        ...
      SWAIG:
        ...
```

---

### Prompt and Post Prompt

The `prompt` parameter is used to define the AI's purpose and his personality traits.
Within `prompt` also define the AI's `top_p`, `temperature` and `text` parameters, which are used to control the
AI's response.

The `top_p` parameter defines the probability of the AI's response, while the `temperature` parameter
defines the randomness of the AI's response.

The prompts `text` parameter uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to format the text.
This allows us to break down the conversation into steps using Markdown headers, making it easier for the Santa AI to follow and understand
the conversation flow. Here, we are using the `###` header to define the steps of the conversation.
We include a brief description of each step, as well as the function that will be used during that step.
In each step, we include specific instructions for the AI to following while on that current step, such as
letting the user they can only choose one gift after already choosing a gift.

The `post_prompt_url` parameter is used to define the webhook that will be called after the AI's conversation is complete.
This webhook will be sent the logs of the conversation which will contain a transcript of the conversation
and `SWAIG` function calls. For testing purposes, it is recommended
to use [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to view the post prompt logs. This site will provide a unique URL that can
be used as the `post_prompt_url`.


```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        top_p: 0.3
        temperature: 0.6
        text: |-
          Greet the user in a festive manner.
          Engage with a child as Santa Claus, spreading Christmas joy.
          In a jolly Santa voice, ask one cute, festive question at a time to discover what the children want for Christmas.
          ### Step 1 Ask them what they want for christmas.
          ### Step 2 Use the present_lookup function to search for the requested gift and provide a summary.
          If the presents summary is empty, explain there's an issue with the elves at Amazon and suggest trying later and then hangup.
          ### Step 3 Ask the child to pick one out of the top three presents listed in the presents summary.
          If the user wants a different present, acknowledge they want a different present and go back to Step 1.
          ### Step 4 Ensure the chosen present is from the present summary.
          If multiple presents are selected, request the child to choose only one.
          ### Step 5 Once confirmed, use the send_present function to finalize the gift choice.
          ### Step 6 Continue the conversation, keeping it playful and entertaining.
          If another present is requested, gently remind them that only one gift can be chosen.
      post_prompt_url: Post Prompt Webhook Here
```

### Languages and Voices
This section covers how we are using the `elevenlabs` engine to use Santa's voice as the default voice.

Santa's voice is defined in the `voice` parameter, which is set to `gvU4yEv29ZpMc9IXoZcd` for both languages. We use the
`code` parameter to define the language code, which is `en-US` for English. The `fillers` parameter
is used to define the filler words Santa uses to make his speech more natural. These fillers are
randomly selected and inserted into Santa's speech, making it more realistic.

```yaml andJson
languages:
  - name: English
    code: en-US
    voice: gvU4yEv29ZpMc9IXoZcd
    engine: elevenlabs
    fillers:
      - one moment please,
      - uhh ha,
      - aah ha,
      - hmm...
      - let's see,
```

---

### ElevenLabs Voice Parameters

We use ElevenLabs TTS engine-specific parameters to fine-tune Santa's voice. These parameters are configured per-language using `languages[].params`.

The `stability` parameter controls the stability of the AI's voice, while the `similarity` parameter defines how closely the voice adheres to the original voice characteristics.
This allows us to control the AI's voice and make it more realistic and as close to Santa's voice as possible.

You can learn more about these settings here: [Eleven Labs Documentation](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/speech-synthesis/voice-settings#stability).

```yaml andJson
languages:
  - name: English
    code: en-US
    voice: elevenlabs.rachel
    params:
      stability: 0.1
      similarity: 0.25
```

### SWAIG: SignalWire AI Gateway

SWAIG is an essential component of our Santa AI, housing the critical functions that make the magic happen. The two
functions we will be focusing on are `present_lookup` and `send_present`. These functions are responsible for searching
Amazon for the top three gifts based on a user's input and sending an SMS to the users phone with a link to the chosen
gift, respectively. Additionally, the AI will also be using `native_functions` which are functions that are built into the
AI and do not require any setup.

#### `native_functions`

- `check_time` - Checks the time of day and returns a string of the time of day to the AI to refer to during the conversation.

```yaml andJson
SWAIG:
  native_functions:
  - check_time
```

---


#### `present_lookup` Function

The `present_lookup` function plays a crucial role in the Santa AI experience. It enables Santa to search and
provide three gifts as options for the user to choose from.
based on a user's input. When the `present_lookup` function is called, it will make a GET request to the [Real-Time Amazon Data API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-amazon-data/)
to search for gifts based on the user's input. The API will return a payload containing the
search results, which will be used to generate a summary of the top three gifts.

This function adds an element of realism to the interaction, as it
mimics Santa's ability to know all the best gifts and where to find them.


```yaml andJson
SWAIG:
  functions:
  - function: present_lookup
  meta_data_token: summary
  purpose: To look for presents on Amazon, getting top 3 results.
  argument:
    type: object
    properties:
      query:
        type: string
        description: the present to look up
  data_map:
    webhooks:
    - require_args: query
      error_keys: error
      url: https://real-time-amazon-data.p.rapidapi.com/search?query=${lc:enc:args.query}&page=1&country=US&category_id=aps
      method: GET
      headers:
        X-RapidAPI-Key: Rapid API Token Here
        X-RapidAPI-Host: real-time-amazon-data.p.rapidapi.com
      foreach:
        input_key: data.products
        output_key: summary
        max: 3
        append: 'title: ${this.product_title} photo: ${this.product_photo}
          url: ${this.product_url}'
      output:
        response: |
          If the present summary is not empty, repeat the titles of the top 3 presents from the summary to the user.
          ### Present Summary:
          ${summary}
        action:
        - toggle_functions:
          - active: true
            function: send_present
```

**Explanation of the `present_lookup` function:**

- **`purpose`** - This parameter is used to describe the purpose of the function.

- **`argument`** - This parameter is used to define the arguments that the function requires.

- **`properties`** - This parameter is used to define the properties of the argument. In this case, the `query` argument is a
  string, which represents the present that the user wants to look up.

- **`data_map`** - This parameter is used to define how the function will process the data it receives during the function
  call.

- **`webhooks`** - This parameter is used to define the webhook that will be called during the function call, and its method,
  headers, and the data that will be sent to the webhook. In this case, we are using the [Real-Time Amazon Data API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-amazon-data/)
  to search Amazon for the top three gifts based on the user's input.

- **`require_args`** - This parameter is used to define the arguments that are required for the webhook to be called. In this
  case, the `query` argument is required for the webhook to be called.

- **`error_keys`** - This parameter is used to define the error keys that will be returned from the webhook. In this case, the
  `error` key will be returned if the webhook is not called successfully.

- **`method`** - This parameter is used to define the method that will be used to call the webhook. In this case, we are using
  the `GET` method to call the webhook.

- **`url`** - This parameter is used to define the URL of the webhook. In this case, we are calling the [Real-Time Amazon Data API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-amazon-data/)
  to search Amazon for the top three gifts based on the user's input, in a serverless manner.
  When the request is made, the following parameters will be passed to the API as query strings:
  - `query` - The search query to look up on Amazon. This will be the present that the user wants to look up.
  - `country` - The country code of the Amazon domain to search on.
  - `category_id` - The category ID of the Amazon category to search in.
  - `page` - The page number of the search results to return.

  The `lc:enc:` prefix is used to lowercase and encode the argument, which is required for the webhook to be called properly.


- **`headers`** - This parameter is used to define the headers that will be sent to the webhook. The `X-RapidAPI-Key` header is used to
  authenticate the webhook using the Rapid API token, while the `X-RapidAPI-Host` header is used to define the host of the
  webhook. Make sure to replace the `X-RapidAPI-Key` header with your Rapid API token and the `X-RapidAPI-Host` header with
  the host of the webhook which can be found on the [Real-Time Amazon Data API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-amazon-data/) page.

- **`foreach`** - This parameter is used to iterate through the data that is returned from the webhook. In this case, we are
  iterating through the `data.products` array that is returned from [Real-Time Amazon Data API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-amazon-data/)
  and then using `append` to add the `title`, `photo`, and `url` of the first three products to the `summary` variable.

- **`response`** - This parameter is used to define the response that will be sent to the AI after the function is complete.
  In this case, we are letting the AI know that we are repeating the top three presents that are stored in the `summary`
  variable. If the `summary` variable is empty, we will let the AI know that there was an issue with the elves at Amazon,
  and suggest trying again later. This will prevent the Santa AI from sending the user an SMS with a link to a gift that
  does not exist. This usually happens the [Real-Time Amazon Data API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-amazon-data/) fails.

- **`output`** - This parameter is used to define the output of the function. In this case, we are feeding the `summary`
  variable to the `response` parameter, which will be used to summarize the results of the search.
  This will allow the Santa AI to repeat the top three gifts to the user.

- **`action`** - This parameter is used to define the action that will be taken after the function is complete. In this case,
  we are using the `toggle_functions` action to toggle the `send_present` function `active` state to `true`, which will allow the Santa AI to
  send the chosen gift to the user.

#### `send_present` Function

Following the `present_lookup` function, the child will be asked to choose their preferred gift from the top three gifts that
were returned from the `present_lookup` function. The `send_present` function will then send an SMS to the user with a link
to the chosen gift.


```yaml andJson
SWAIG:
    function: send_present
    meta_data_token: summary
    purpose: To send an SMS of an Amazon present to the user.
    active: 'false'
    argument:
      type: object
      properties:
        present_title:
          type: string
          description: The title of the present to send to the user.
        present_url:
          type: string
          description: The url of the present to send to the user.
        present_photo:
          type: string
          description: The photo of the present to send to the user.
    data_map:
      expressions:
      - pattern: ".*"
        string: ".*"
        output:
          response: Let the user know that the present will be delivered on
            Christmas.
          action:
          - toggle_functions:
              - active: false
                function: present_lookup
              - active: false
                function: send_present
          - SWML:
              version: 1.0.0
              sections:
                main:
                - send_sms:
                    to_number: "${caller_id_num}"
                    body: |-
                      Hey there, its Santa Claus!
                      As we discussed, here's the link for the ${args.present_title} you wanted for Christmas: ${args.present_url}
                      Have a Merry Christmas!
                    from_number: "Your SignalWire Number Here"
                    media:
                      - "${args.present_photo}"
```

**Explanation of the `send_present` function:**

- **`purpose`** - This parameter is used to describe the purpose of the function.

- **`active`** - This parameter is used to define whether the function is active or not. In this case, the function is set to
  `false` by default, as it will be toggled on by the `present_lookup` function. This will prevent Santa Ai from sending
  the user an SMS before they have chosen their preferred gift.

- **`argument`** - This parameter is used to define the arguments that the function requires.

- **`properties`** - This parameter is used to define the properties of the argument. In this case, we have a
`present_title`, `present_url`, and `present_photo` argument, which represent the title, url, and photo of the present
that the user wants to send to the user.

- **`data_map`** - This parameter is used to define how the function will process the data it receives during the function
  call.

- **`expressions`** - This parameter is used to define the expressions that will be used to process the data that is received
  during the function call. In this case, we are using the `.*` expression to match any string that is received during the
  function call and feeding it to the `response` parameter. The `string` the expression is being fed to is the `present`
  argument, which is the present url that the user will receive as a sms.

- **`response`** - This parameter is used to define the response that will be sent to the AI after the function is complete.
  In this case, we are letting the AI know that we are sending the present to the user's phone as a text message.

- **`action`** - This parameter is used to define the action that will be taken after the function is complete. In this case,
  we are using the `toggle_functions` action to turn the `active` state of both the `send_present` and `present_lookup` function to `false`.
  This will prevent the AI from sending the user additional SMS messages after the gift has been sent, as well as prevent
  the AI from looking up additional gifts. The `SWML` action is also action used to embed a separate `SWML` script into the current `SWML` script.
  This will allow us to call the `send_sms` method, which will send the chosen gift url to the user's phone as an SMS.
  We are using the `caller_id_num` variable to define the `to_number` parameter, which will send the SMS to the current callee's phone number.

---


### Final SWML Script

:::caution
If you are finding that the SMS is not being sent to your phone, even after replacing the `from_number`
parameter with your own SignalWire phone number, it may be due to the fact that you have not registered your phone numbers messaging.
Depending on if the phone number is a 10DLC or Toll-Free number, you will need to register or verify your phone number for messaging.

More information on 10DLC Message Campaign Registration can be found [here](/messaging/get-started/campaign-registry).

More information on Toll-Free Number Verification can be found [here](/messaging/guides/general/toll-free-number-overview#get-verified).

If you do not wish to register or verify your phone number, you can check the logs in the `post_prompt_url`
to see if the SMS was sent successfully in the `SWAIG logs` section.
:::



**Replace the following values:**
- `post_prompt_url` - Replace with your own post prompt webhook URL. Use [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) for testing purposes.
- `X-RapidAPI-Key` - Replace with your own Rapid API token which can be found on the [Real-Time Amazon Data API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-amazon-data/) page.
- `X-RapidAPI-Host` - Replace with the host of the webhook which can be found on the [Real-Time Amazon Data API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-amazon-data/) page.
- `from_number` - Replace with your own SignalWire phone number.
