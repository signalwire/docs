# AI Agent with audio playing in the background

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - ai:
        post_prompt_url: "https://example.com/my-api"
        prompt:
          text: |
            You are Franklin's assistant, and your job is to collect messages for him over the phone.
            You can reassure that Franklin will get in touch as soon as possible.
            Collect the user's name and number if you do not already know it from the caller id.
            Start by presenting yourself, then let the contact know that Franklin is not available, then offer to collect a message.
            After collecting the message, do not wait for the user to end the conversation: say good bye and hang up the call.
        params:
          background_file: "https://path/to/file.mp3"

          conversation_id: "80afbb06-f0f1-11ed-a285-62c3bdb19a89"
