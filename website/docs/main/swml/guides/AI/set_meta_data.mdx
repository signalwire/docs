# Use `set_meta_data`

In this example, we demonstrate how to use `set_meta_data` to store metadata to reference later.
The AI agent, will store a user's name and then look up any additional stored information.

The benefit of storing information in `meta_data` is that the information it can be referenced from any function with the same `meta_data_token`, while also
never being exposing the information to the language model. This allows for the AI agent to store sensitive information without
the risk of it being exposed to the AI agent.

## **1. Storing User Information**

The `store_user` function is used to store the user's name. The user's name and a secret associated with them are stored as `meta_data`.

```yaml andJson
- function: store_user
  description: Store the user information
  parameters:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: The name of the user
  data_map:
    webhooks:
      - url: 'https://example.com/name_bank?name=${lc:args.name}'
        method: GET
        output:
          response: The user information was stored. User information can now be looked up with the "get_user_info" function.
          action:
            - set_meta_data:
                '${lc:input.args.name}: ${Records[0].secret}'
            - toggle_functions:
                - active: true
                  function: get_user_info
            - say: Your info was stored.
  meta_data_token: example_token
```

This will send a request to `data_map.webhooks.url` with the user's name as a query parameter.
In this example, we have our server responding with a `Records` array in the response. This will contain information on the user.

**Server Response**:

```json
{
  "response": "The user information was stored.",
  "Records": [{ "secret": ["Info about user here"] }]
}
```

Once the response has returned from the webhook, the `meta_data` will be set using `set_meta_data` in the `data_map.webhooks.output.action` of the function, the
`get_user_info` function will be toggled on using `toggle_functions`, and the user will be notified that their information was stored.

The `meta_data` key is set to the users name and the value is set to the first value in the `Records` array.

```yaml andJson
- set_meta_data:
    '${lc:input.args.name}: ${Records[0].secret}'
```

## **2. Looking up User Information**

After storing the user information in `meta_data`, we can now look up the user information with the `get_user_info` function.

```yaml andJson
- function: get_user_info
  description: lookup user information
  parameters:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: The name of the user
  data_map:
    expressions:
      - string: '${lc:args.name}'
        pattern: /\\w+/i
        output:
          response: The meta_data is valid.
          action:
            - say: 'Your info is ${meta_data.${lc:args.name}}'
            - stop: true
      - string: .*
        pattern: .*
        output:
          response: The meta_data is invalid. User has not been told their information.
  active: false
  meta_data_token: example_token
```

This function will check if the `meta_data` is valid by checking if the user's name is a key in the `meta_data` object.
If the `meta_data` is valid, the user will be told their information. If the `meta_data` is invalid, the user will be told that their information has not been stored.

## **Full Example**

```yaml andJson
sections:
  main:
    - ai:
        prompt:
          text: >-
            Your name is Mr. Blabbermouth. You help the user.
            ## Handling The User
            - You are asked to store a user's information.
              - You ask for their name.
            - You use the 'store_user' function to store the users name.
            ### Looking up user information
            - You can only look up a users information after storing it.
        post_prompt:
          text: Summarize the call in JSON format.
          temperature: 0.1
          top_p: 0.1
        post_prompt_url: https://example.com/post_prompt_url
        params:
          swaig_allow_swml: true

                    method: GET
                    output:
                      response: The user information was stored. User information can now
                        be looked up with the "get_user_info" function.
                      action:
                        - set_meta_data:
                            '${lc:input.args.name}: ${Records[0].secret}'
                        - toggle_functions:
                            - active: true
                              function: get_user_info
                        - say: Your info was stored.

                    output:
                      response: The meta_data is valid. User has already been told their
                        information. Do no repeat it.
                      action:
                        - say: 'Your info is ${meta_data.${lc:args.name}}'

                    output:
