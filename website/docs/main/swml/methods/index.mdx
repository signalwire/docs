title: Methods overview
---


Methods in SWML control the program flow and execute functions.
This includes setting and unsetting variables, conditional statements,
making calls, and sending faxes etc.

## **The `AI` method**

The [`ai`](./ai/index.mdx) method is an incredibly powerful tool to instantiate an AI agent
that holds a natural conversation with the caller, and perform actions based on their input.

## **Control-flow methods**

### `execute` and `return`

The [`execute`](./execute.mdx) method is similar to a function call in most languages. It can be sent parameters,
and it can return values using the [`return`](./return.mdx) object. The SWML function to be executed can
exist as a subsection in the same SWML document, but it can also be a separate SWML document hosted on
an internet-accessible web-server.

### `transfer`

The [`transfer`](/swml/methods/transfer) statement transfers the execution to a different section or
a different SWML document. Unlike the `execute` statement, the `transfer` statement doesn't return
back to the calling section.

### `goto` and `label`

The [`goto`](./goto.mdx) statement can jump to a specified [`label`](./label.mdx) either depending on a
given condition or unconditionally, and repeatedly for a specified number of repetitions.

### `cond` and `switch`

The [`cond`](./cond.mdx) statement is a general purpose conditional branching statement that
executes SWML code based on the evaluation of a JavaScript expression.

The [`switch`](./switch.mdx) statement allows switch-case like conditional execution depending on whether a certain variable is
a certain value.

## **Call related methods**

### `answer` and `hangup`

Use these methods to decide when to [`answer`](./answer.mdx) the call
and when to [`hangup`](./hangup.mdx). Some other methods (like [`play`](./play.mdx))
will automatically answer calls, but you can use these methods to be more
specific about when it happens.

### `denoise` and `stop_denoise`

The [`denoise`](./denoise.mdx) method starts the noise reduction filter and the
[`stop_denoise`](./stop_denoise.mdx) method stops it.


### `live_transcribe`

The [`live_transcribe`](./live_transcribe/index.mdx) method starts a live transcription of the call.

### `live_translate`

The [`live_translate`](./live_translate/index.mdx) method starts a live translation of the call.

### `play` and `prompt`

The [`play`](./play.mdx) method can be used to send TTS speech, play audio files, send different rings etc.
The [`prompt`](./prompt.mdx) method also plays TTS or URLs like `play` but it can receive
keypad or speech input in response.

### `connect`

Use the [`connect`](./connect/index.mdx) method to connect the caller to other phone or SIP calls.
You can set it up to dial multiple numbers in series, parallel or a combination of the two.

### `join_room`

The [`join_room`](./join_room.mdx) method seamlessly connects your call to a
[video room](/video/conference), enabling participants to
join from various sources, including mobile apps, web browsers, or phone calls.

### `receive_fax`

The [`receive_fax`](./receive_fax.mdx) method will interpret the call as a fax and process it.

### `record`, `record_call` and `stop_record_call`

The [`record`](./record.mdx) and the [`record_call`](./record_call.mdx) methods will record
the call. The `record` method, however, waits for the recording to terminate before continuing
execution. The [`record_call`](./record_call.mdx) method starts a call recording in the
background, and it stops recording when you call [`stop_record_call`](./stop_record_call.mdx).

### `tap` and `stop_tap`

The [`tap`](./tap.mdx) method starts streaming the call to an RTP or a web socket sink.
The [`stop_tap`](./stop_tap.mdx) method stops it.

### `sip_refer`

The [`sip_refer`](./sip_refer.mdx) method transfer a SIP call by sending a SIP REFER
message.

### `send_sms`

Use [`send_sms`](./send_sms.mdx) to send an SMS to a phone number.

### `send_digits`

Use [`send_digits`](./send_digits.mdx) to send digits as DTMF tones.
