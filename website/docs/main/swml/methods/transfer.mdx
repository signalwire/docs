tags: ['swml']
---

import APIField from "@site/src/components/APIField";

Transfer the execution of the script to a different `SWML section`, `URL`, or `Relay application`. Once
the transfer is complete, the script will continue executing SWML from the new location.

<APIField
  name="transfer"
  type="object"
  required={true}
>
  An object that accepts the [`transfer parameters`](#transfer-parameters).
</APIField>

## **transfer Parameters**

<APIField
  name="transfer.dest"
  type="string"
  required={true}
>
  Specifies where to transfer to. The value can be one of:
  - `"<section_name>"` - section in the SWML document to jump to
  - A URL (http or https) - URL to fetch next document from. Sends HTTP POST. Authentication can also be set in the url in the format of `username:password@url`.
  - An inline SWML document (as a JSON string) - SWML document provided directly as a JSON string
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="transfer.params"
  type="object"
>
  Named parameters to send to a section, URL, or application.
</APIField>

## **Valid Destination Values** {#valid-destination-values}

The destination string can be one of:

- `"section_name"` - section in the current document to execute.
(For example: `execute: main`)
- `"relay:<relay application>"` - relay application to notify (currently not implemented)
- `"https://example.com/sub-swml.yaml"` - URL pointing to the document to execute.
An HTTP POST request will be sent to the URL. Authentication can also be set in the url in the format of `username:password@url`.
The `params` object is passed, along with the variables and the [`Call`](/swml/guides/deployment#the-call-object) object.

## **Examples**

### Basic transfer to a URL

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - transfer:
        dest: "https://example.com/next"
```

### Basic transfer to a section

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - play:
        url: 'say:Transferring you to another section'
    - transfer:
        dest: subsection
    - play:
        url: 'say:Back!'
  subsection:
    - play:
        url: 'say:inside a subsection'
```


### Named parameter with sub-parameters

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - transfer:
        - dest: "https://example.com/next"
        - params:
            - foo: "bar"
```


### Transfer to a SWML script hosted on a server

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - prompt:
        play: >-
          say: Press 1 to be transfered to the Sales department, 2 for marketing
          department or anything else to listen to some music.
    - switch:
        variable: prompt_value
        case:
          '1':
            - transfer:
                dest: 'https://<YOUR_NGROK_UUID>.ngrok-free.app'
                params:
                  where: sales
          '2':
            - transfer:
                dest: 'https://<YOUR_NGROK_UUID>.ngrok-free.app'
                params:
                  where: marketing
    - play:
        url: 'https://cdn.signalwire.com/swml/April_Kisses.mp3'
```

A minimal server for this SWML script can be written as follows:

<Tabs groupId="cxml-api">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python/Flask">

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from waitress import serve

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=['POST'])
def swml():
    content = request.get_json(silent=True)
    print(content)
    return '''
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - play:
        url: 'say: Welcome to the {} department.'
'''.format(content['params']['where'])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    serve(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=6000)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript/Express">

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

// note the POST method
app.post("/", (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body;
  console.log(data);
  res.send(`
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - play:
        url: 'say: Welcome to the {} department.'
  `);
});

const port = 6000;
app.listen(port);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This server (running on `localhost`) can be made accessible to the wider web (and thus this SWML script) using forwarding tools like `ngrok`.
You can follow our [Testing webhooks with ngrok](https://developer.signalwire.com/platform/basics/guides/technical-troubleshooting/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok) guide to learn how.

The server will be sent the payload in the following format:

```json
{
  "call": {
    "call_id": "<call_id>",
    "node_id": "<node_id>",
    "segment_id": "<segment_id>",
    "call_state": "answered",
    "direction": "inbound",
    "type": "phone",
    "from": "<address>",
    "to": "<address>",
    "from_number": "<address>",
    "to_number": "<address>",
    "headers": [],
    "project_id": "<your Project UUID>",
    "space_id": "<your Space UUID>"
  },
  "vars": {
    "answer_result": "success",
    "prompt_result": "match_digits",
    "prompt_value_raw": "2",
    "prompt_value": "2"
  },
  "params": { "where": "marketing" }
}
```

The `call` object is described in detail in the [introduction](/swml/guides/deployment#the-call-object). 
All variables created within the SWML document are passed inside `vars`, 
and the `params` object contains the parameters defined in the `params` parameter of `transfer`.
