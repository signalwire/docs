In the below example, the SWML script answers an incoming call and then starts recording the call.
The script then initiates a `start` action to start a live translation session.
The script then connects the call to a destination number.
After the call is connected, the script plays a message to the caller stating that the translation session is ending.
Finally, the script stops the live translation by passing the `stop` action.

```yaml andJson
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - record_call:
        format: wav
        stereo: 'true'
    - live_translate:
        action:
          start:
            webhook: 'https://example.com/webhook'
            from_lang: en
            from_voice: en-US
            live_events: true
            direction:
              - remote-caller
              - local-caller
    - connect:
        from: '+1XXXXXXXXXX'
        to: '+1XXXXXXXXXX'
    - play:
        url: 'say: Thank you for using the live translation service. We will now end the translation session.'
    - live_translate:
        action: "stop"
```
