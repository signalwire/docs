In the below example, the SWML script answers an incoming call and then starts recording the call.
The script then starts a live translation session by using the `start` action. The script will translate the conversation from English to Spanish.
After the translation session has started, the script connects the call to a destination number.

```yaml andJson
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - record_call:
        format: wav
        stereo: 'true'
    - live_translate:
        action:
          start:
            webhook: 'https://example.com/webhook'
            to_voice: elevenlabs.rachel
