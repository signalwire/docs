In the below example, the SWML script answers an incoming call and then starts recording the call.
Once the call is answered and recording has started, the call is then connected to a destination number.
After the call is connected, the script injects the message `This is an injected message` into the conversation
for the `remote-caller` to hear.


```yaml andJson
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - record_call:
        format: wav
        stereo: 'true'
    - connect:
        from: '+1XXXXXXXXXX'
        to: '+1XXXXXXXXXX'
    - live_translate:
        action:
          inject:
            message: This is an injected message.
            direction: remote-caller
```
