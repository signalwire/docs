## **Examples**

### Receive a fax and post a result to a webhook

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - receive_fax: {}
    - execute:
        dest: 'https://<NGROK UUID>.ngrok-free.app'
```

In this example, when a fax is received, a POST request will be sent to the URL with all
the fax related variables (like `receive_fax_document`) already set.
Refer to the [`execute`](./execute.mdx) statement's documentation for more details on this behavior.
