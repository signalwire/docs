Enable secure payment processing during voice calls. When implemented in your voice application, it manages the entire payment flow, including data collection, validation, and processing, through your configured payment gateway.

## **Transaction Types**

The `pay` method supports two primary transaction types: `charges` and `tokenization`.

### Charges

When you need to process a payment right away, use a charge transaction. 
This collects the payment details and processes the transaction in real-time.

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - pay:
        charge_amount: 25.00
        payment_connector_url: "https://example.com/process"
```
Setting any positive value for `charge_amount` initiates a charge transaction.

### Tokenization

Tokenization allows you to securely store payment information for future use. Instead of processing a payment immediately, it generates a secure token that represents the payment method.
To initiate a tokenization transaction, either pass `charge_amount` as `0` or omit the `charge_amount` attribute entirely.

:::note
The token is provided and stored by your payment processor and can be used for future transactions without requiring customers
to re-enter their payment details. Note that this behavior may vary depending on the payment processor you are using.
:::

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - pay:
        charge_amount: 0
        payment_connector_url: "https://example.com/process"
```
