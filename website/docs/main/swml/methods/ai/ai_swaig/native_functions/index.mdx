import APIField from "@site/src/components/APIField";

The AI agent is already aware of these functions and can use them creatively based on prompting.
For example, a prompt like, "tell the user what time it is" will automatically use the `check_time`
function internally. Similarly, a prompt like, "ask the question and wait 10 seconds to let the user check",
will automatically invoke the `wait_seconds` function with the appropriate parameters.
