[reserved-functions]: #reserved-functions
[post-prompt]: /swml/methods/ai/post_prompt

An array of JSON objects to define functions that can be executed during the interaction with the AI.

<APIField
  name="functions"
  type="object[]"
>
  An array of JSON objects that accept the [`functions Parameters`](#parameters).
</APIField>


## **functions Parameters** {#parameters}

<APIField
  name="description"
  type="string"
  required={true}
>
  A description of the context and purpose of the function, to explain to the agent when to use it.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="function"
  type="string"
  required={true}
>
  A unique name for the function. This can be any user-defined string or can reference a reserved function. Reserved functions are SignalWire functions that will be executed at certain points in the conversation. To learn more about reserved functions, see [Reserved Functions][reserved-functions].
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="active"
  type="boolean"
  default="true"
>
  Whether the function is active.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="data_map"
  type="[object](/swml/methods/ai/swaig/functions/data_map)"
>
  An object containing properties to process or validate the input, perform actions based on the input, or connect to external APIs or services in a serverless fashion.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="parameters"
  type="[object](/swml/methods/ai/swaig/functions/parameters)"
>
  A JSON object that defines the expected user input parameters and their validation rules for the function.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="fillers"
  type="[object](/swml/methods/ai/swaig/functions/fillers)"
>
  A JSON object defining the fillers that should be played when calling a `swaig function`. This helps the AI break silence between responses. The filler is played asynchronously during the function call.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="skip_fillers"
  type="boolean"
  default="false"
>
  Skips the top-level fillers specified in [`ai.languages`](/swml/methods/ai/languages) (which includes `speech_fillers` and `function_fillers`). When set to `true`, only function-specific fillers defined directly on [`SWAIG.functions.fillers`](/swml/methods/ai/swaig/functions/fillers) will play.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="meta_data"
  type="object"
>
  A powerful and flexible environmental variable which can accept arbitrary data that is set initially in the SWML script or from the SWML [`set_meta_data` action](./ai_swaig.data_map/data_map.output.mdx#actions). This data can be referenced **locally** to the function. All contained information can be accessed and expanded within the prompt - for example, by using a template string.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="meta_data_token"
  type="string"
  default="Set by SignalWire"
>
  Scoping token for `meta_data`. If not supplied, metadata will be scoped to function's `web_hook_url`.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="wait_file"
  type="string"
>
  A file to play while the function is running. `wait_file_loops` can specify the amount of times that files should continously play.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="wait_file_loops"
  type="string | integer"
>
  The amount of times that `wait_file` should continuously play/loop.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="wait_for_fillers"
  type="boolean"
  default="false"
>
  Whether to wait for fillers to finish playing before continuing with the function.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="web_hook_url"
  type="string"
>
  Function-specific URL to send status callbacks and reports to. Takes precedence over a default setting. Authentication can also be set in the url in the format of `username:password@url`. See [Callback Parameters](./functions.web_hook_url.mdx) for details on the request body.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="purpose"
  type="string"
  deprecated={true}
>
  Deprecated. Use `description` instead.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="argument"
  type="object"
  deprecated={true}
>
  Deprecated. Use `parameters` instead.
</APIField>



## **Reserved Functions** {#reserved-functions}

Reserved functions are special SignalWire functions that are automatically triggered at specific points during a conversation.
You define them just like any other SWAIG function, but their names correspond to built-in logic on the SignalWire platform,
allowing them to perform specific actions at the appropriate time.

:::warning Function name conflicts
Do not use reserved function names for your own SWAIG functions unless you want to use the reserved function's built-in behavior.
Otherwise, your function may not work as expected.
:::

### List of Reserved Functions

<APIField
  name="start_hook"
  type="function"
>
  Triggered when the call is answered. Sends the set properties of the function to the defined `web_hook_url`.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="stop_hook"
  type="function"
>
  Triggered when the call is ended. Sends the set properties of the function to the defined `web_hook_url`.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="summarize_conversation"
  type="function"
>
  Triggered when the call is ended. The [`post_prompt`][post-prompt] must be defined for this function to be triggered. Provides a summary of the conversation and any set properties to the defined `web_hook_url`.
</APIField>

:::important Where are my function properties?
If the AI is not returning the properties you set in your SWAIG function, it may be because a reserved function was triggered before
those properties were available. To ensure your function receives all necessary information, make sure the AI has access to the
required property values before the reserved function is called. Any property missing at the time the reserved function runs will
not be included in the data sent back.

## Diagram examples {#diagrams}

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SW System
    participant User
    participant AI
    participant SWAIG

    %% Call starts
    SW System->>AI: Event: Call answered
    AI->>SWAIG: Trigger reserved function start_hook
    SWAIG->>AI: start_hook response

    %% User asks a simple question (no function needed)
    User->>AI: "Hello, who am I speaking with?"
    Note right of AI: Intent does NOT match a function
    AI->>User: "You are speaking with the SignalWire assistant."

    %% User asks for weather (triggers function)
    User->>AI: "What's the weather in Paris?"
    Note right of AI: Intent matches get_weather function
    AI->>SWAIG: Call get_weather with location=Paris
    SWAIG->>AI: Response payload:<br>{ "location": "Paris", "temp": "75°F", "condition": "Sunny" }
    AI->>User: "It's sunny and 75°F in Paris."

    %% Call ends
    SW System->>AI: Event: Call ended
    AI->>SWAIG: Trigger reserved function stop_hook
    SWAIG->>AI: stop_hook response

    %% Conversation ends (post_prompt defined)
    SW System->>AI: Event: Conversation ended
    AI->>SWAIG: Trigger reserved function summarize_conversation
```

            You are a helpful assistant that can provide information to users about a destination.
            At the start of the conversation, always ask the user for their name.
            You can use the appropriate function to get the phone number, address,
            or weather information.
        post_prompt:
          text: "Summarize the conversation."
