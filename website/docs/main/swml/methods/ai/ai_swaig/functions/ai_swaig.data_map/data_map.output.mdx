Similar to a `return` statement in conventional programming languages, the `data_map.output` object immediately
terminates function execution and returns control to the caller. When encountered, it returns two values:

1. A `response` object: Contains static text that will be incorporated into the AI agent's context
2. An `action` object: Defines one or more executable [actions](#actions) that are triggered when the SWAIG function successfully completes

Just as a `return` statement prevents any subsequent code from executing in a traditional function, once `data_map.output`
is processed, no further instructions within the SWAIG function will be executed.
