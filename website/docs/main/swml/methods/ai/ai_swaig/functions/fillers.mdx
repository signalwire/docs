import APIField from "@site/src/components/APIField";

The `fillers` object is used to define language-specific filler phrases that should be played when calling a `swaig function`. These fillers help break silence between responses and are played asynchronously during the function call.

<APIField
  name="fillers"
  type="object"
>
  An object containing language-specific arrays of filler phrases. Must specify exactly one language code.
</APIField>

## Language Codes

The fillers object accepts a single language code as a property key, with an array of filler phrases as its value.

<APIField
  name="[key: string]"
  type="string[]"
  required={true}
>
  An object with language codes as the property, where:<ul><li>**Key:** Must be one of the supported [language codes](#supported-language-codes)</li><li>**Value:** An array of strings containing filler phrases that will be randomly selected during function execution</li></ul>
</APIField>
