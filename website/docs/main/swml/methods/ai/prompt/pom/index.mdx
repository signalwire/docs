## Prompt Object Model (POM)


The prompt object model (POM) is a structured data format designed for composing, organizing, and rendering prompt instructions for AI agents.
POM helps users create prompts that are clearly structured and easy to understand.
It allows for efficient editing, management, and maintenance of prompts. 
By breaking prompts into sections, users can manage each section independently and then combine them into a single cohesive prompt.

SignalWire will render the prompt into a markdown document.

If the `text` parameter is present while using `pom`, the `pom` prompt will be used instead of `text`.

<APIField
  name="pom"
  type="object[]"
>
  An array of objects that defines the prompt object model (POM) for the AI. Each object represents a [`section`][section] in the POM.
</APIField>


## section parameters {#section}

Each section can contain one of the two valid objects. One of `body` or `bullets` or pass both is required.

<APIField
  name="title"
  type="string"
>
  The title of the section. Will be a heading in the rendered prompt.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="body"
  type="string"
>
  The body of the section. This will be a paragraph in the rendered prompt. 
  
  **Note:** This parameter is `required` if `bullets` is not present.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="bullets"
  type="string[]"
>
  An array of strings that represent the bullets of the section. 
  This will be a list of short statements/rules in the rendered prompt. 
  
  **Note:** This parameter is `optional` if `body` is present.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="subsections"
  type="object[]"
>
  An array of objects that defines the prompt object model (POM) for the AI. Each object represents a `section` in the POM allowing the users to nest sections within sections.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="numbered"
  type="boolean"
  default="`false`"
>
  If `true`, the section will be numbered in the rendered prompt.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="numberedBullets"
  type="boolean"
  default="`false`"
>
  If `true`, the bullets will be numbered in the rendered prompt.
</APIField>


## Example

Below is an example of using the POM to create a prompt.

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - ai:
        prompt:
          text: "Prompt is defined in pom"
          pom:
            - title: "Agent Personality"
              body: "You are a friendly and engaging assistant. Keep the conversation light and fun."
              subsections: 
                - title: "Personal Information"
                  numberedBullets: true
                  bullets:
                    - "You are a AI Agent"
                    - "Your name is Frank"
                    - "You work at SignalWire"
            - title: "Task"
              body: "You are to ask the user a series of questions to gather information."
              bullets: 
                - "Ask the user to provide their name"
                - "Ask the user to provide their favorite color"
                - "Ask the user to provide their favorite food"
                - "Ask the user to provide their favorite movie"
                - "Ask the user to provide their favorite TV show"
                - "Ask the user to provide their favorite music"
                - "Ask the user to provide their favorite sport"
                - "Ask the user to provide their favorite animal"
```
