1. **Audio file from a URL**<br/>
   To play an audio file from the web, simply list that audio's URL.
   Specified audio file should be accessible with an HTTP GET request.
   `HTTP` and `HTTPS` URLs are supported. Authentication can also be set in the url in the format of `username:password@url`.

    Example: `https://cdn.signalwire.com/swml/audio.mp3`

2. **Ring**<br/>
   To play the standard ringtone of a certain country, use `ring:[duration:]<country code>`.

   The total duration can be specified in seconds as an optional second parameter. When left unspecified,
   it will ring just once. The country code must be specified. It has values like `us` for United States, `it` for Italy.
   For the list of available country codes, refer to the
   [supported ringtones](#supported-ring-tones) section below. For example:

   `ring:us` - ring with the US ringtone once<br/>
   `ring:3.2:uk` - ring with the UK ringtone for 3.2 seconds

3. **Speak using a TTS**<br/>
   To speak using a TTS, use `say:<text to speak>`. When using say, you can optionally set `say_voice`, `say_language` and
   `say_gender` in the [play or prompt params](#parameters). For the list of useable voices and languages,
   refer to the [supported voices and languages](#supported-voices-and-languages) section below.
