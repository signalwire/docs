import APIField from "@site/src/components/APIField";

Iterates over an array of objects and processes an output based on each element in the array.
Works similarly to JavaScript's [forEach](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_foreach.asp) method.

<APIField
  name="foreach"
  type="object"
>
  An object that contains the [`foreach properties`](#foreach-properties).
</APIField>


## **foreach Properties**

<APIField
  name="append"
  type="string"
  required={true}
>
  The values to append to the `output_key`.<br/>Properties from the object can be referenced and added to the `output_key` by using the following syntax: `${this.property_name}`.<br/>The `this` keyword is used to reference the current object in the array.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="input_key"
  type="string"
  required={true}
>
  The key to be used to access the current element in the array.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="max"
  type="number"
>
  The max amount of elements that are iterated over in the array. This will start at the beginning of the array.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="output_key"
  type="string"
  required={true}
>
  The key that can be referenced in the output of the `foreach` iteration. The values that are stored from `append` will be stored in this key.
</APIField>
