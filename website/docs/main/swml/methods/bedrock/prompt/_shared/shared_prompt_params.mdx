<APIField
  name="temperature"
  type="number"
  default="1.0"

<APIField
  name="top_p"
  type="number"
  default="1.0"
>
  Randomness setting. Alternative to `temperature`. Float value between 0.0 and 1.0. Closer to 0 will make the output less random.

<APIField
  name="confidence"
  type="number"
  default="0.6"
>
  Threshold to fire a speech-detect event at the end of the utterance. Float value between 0.0 and 1.0. Decreasing this value will reduce the pause after the user speaks, but may introduce false positives.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="presence_penalty"

<APIField
  name="frequency_penalty"
  type="number"
  default="0"
