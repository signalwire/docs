<APIField
  name="prompt.contexts"
  type="object"
>
  An object that defines the available contexts for the AI. Each context represents a set of steps that guide the flow of the conversation. The object must include a `default` key, which specifies the initial context used at the start of the conversation. Additional contexts can be added as other keys within the object. For more details, see the [contexts technical reference][contexts].
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="prompt.temperature"
  type="number"
  default="1.0"
>
  Randomness setting. Float value between 0.0 and 1.5. Closer to 0 will make the output less random.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="prompt.top_p"
  type="number"
  default="1.0"
>
  Randomness setting. Alternative to `temperature`. Float value between 0.0 and 1.0. Closer to 0 will make the output less random.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="prompt.confidence"
  type="number"
  default="0.6"
>
  Threshold to fire a speech-detect event at the end of the utterance. Float value between 0.0 and 1.0. Decreasing this value will reduce the pause after the user speaks, but may introduce false positives.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="prompt.presence_penalty"
  type="number"
  default="0"
>
  Aversion to staying on topic. Float value between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values increase the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="prompt.frequency_penalty"
  type="number"
  default="0"
>
  Aversion to repeating lines. Float value between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values decrease the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="prompt.max_tokens"
  type="integer"
  default="256"
>
  Limits the amount of tokens that the AI agent may generate when creating its response.<br /> <strong>Valid Value Range:</strong> <code>0</code> - <code>4096</code>
</APIField>
