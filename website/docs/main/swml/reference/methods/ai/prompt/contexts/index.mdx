Contexts allow you to create structured conversation flows with multiple specialized paths. Each context represents a distinct conversation mode with its own steps, memory settings, and transition logic.

Every contexts object requires a `default` key, which serves as the entry point for the conversation. You can define additional contexts as custom keys alongside `default`.

<APIField
  name="ai.prompt.contexts"
  type="object"
>
  An object that accepts the [`contexts parameters`][contexts_parameters].
</APIField>

## contexts Parameters

<APIField
  name="contexts.default"
  type="object"
  required={true}
>
  The default context to use at the beginning of the conversation. This object accepts the [`context object`][context_object].
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="contexts.{context_name}"
  type="object"
>
  Additional contexts to define specialized conversation flows. The key is user-defined and can be any string (e.g., `support`, `sales`, `billing`).<br/> These contexts can be accessed from the `default` context or any other user-defined context.<br/> Each value is a [`context object`][context_object].
</APIField>

## context object

Each context (both `default` and custom contexts) is configured using a context object with the following properties:

<APIField
  name="{context_name}.steps"
  type="object[]"
  required={true}
>
  An array of [step objects][steps_object] that define the conversation flow for this context. Steps execute sequentially unless otherwise specified.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="{context_name}.isolated"
  type="boolean"
  default="false"
>
  When `true`, resets conversation history to only the system prompt when entering this context. Useful for focused tasks that shouldn't be influenced by previous conversation.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="{context_name}.enter_fillers"
  type="object[]"
>
  Language-specific filler phrases played when transitioning into this context. Helps provide smooth context switches.
</APIField>

<APIField
  name="{context_name}.exit_fillers"
  type="object[]"
>
  Language-specific filler phrases played when leaving this context. Ensures natural transitions out of specialized modes.
</APIField>

### Context Transition Fillers

The `enter_fillers` and `exit_fillers` properties enhance user experience by providing natural language transitions between contexts. These fillers play automatically during context transitions, support multiple languages, and are randomly selected from provided options to help maintain conversational flow.

<APIField
  name="enter_fillers.[language_code]"
  type="string[]"
>
  An array of filler phrases for the specified language. The key must be a valid language code from the table below. One phrase is randomly selected during transitions.

  #### Supported Language Codes

  <SupportedLanguageCodes />
</APIField>

## Examples

### Basic Context Structure

Here's a simple example showing the context structure with transition fillers:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - ai:
        prompt:
          text: You are a helpful assistant that can switch between different expertise areas.
          contexts:
            default:
              steps:
                - name: greeting
                  text: Greet the user and ask what they need help with. If they need technical support, transfer them to the support context.
                  valid_contexts:
                    - support
            support:
              isolated: true  # Reset conversation history when entering support mode
              enter_fillers:
                - en-US: ["Switching to technical support", "Let me connect you with support"]
                  es-ES: ["Cambiando a soporte técnico", "Permítame conectarlo con soporte"]
              exit_fillers:
                - en-US: ["Leaving support mode", "Returning to main menu"]
                  es-ES: ["Saliendo del modo de soporte", "Volviendo al menú principal"]
              steps:
                - name: troubleshoot
                  text: Help the user troubleshoot their technical issue. When finished, ask if they need anything else or want to return to the main menu.
                  valid_contexts:
                    - default
```

### Advanced Multi-Context Example

This comprehensive example demonstrates multiple contexts with different AI personalities, voice settings, and specialized knowledge domains:


```yaml andJson
sections:
  main:
    - ai:
        hints:
          - StarWars
          - StarTrek
        languages:
          - name: Ryan-English
            voice: elevenlabs.patrick
            code: en-US
          - name: Luke-English
            voice: elevenlabs.fin
            code: en-US
          - name: Spock-English
            voice: elevenlabs.charlie
            code: en-US
        prompt:
          text: Help the user transfer to the Star Wars or Star Trek expert.
          contexts:
            default:
              steps:
                - name: start
                  text: |+
                    Your name is Ryan. You are a receptionist. Your only purpose is to change the context to starwars or startrek.
                  step_criteria: |+
                    Introduce yourself as Ryan.
                    Ask the user if he would like to talk to a star wars or star trek expert until they provide an adequate answer.
                - name: transfer
                  text: You will now successfully transfer the user to the Star Wars or Star Trek expert.
                  step_criteria: If the user has chosen a valid context, transfer them to the appropriate expert.

                  step_criteria: |+
                    Introduce yourself as Luke, the Star Wars expert.
                    The user must tell you their name if they only say one word assume that is their name.
