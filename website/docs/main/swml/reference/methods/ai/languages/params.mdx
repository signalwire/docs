# languages.params

Use `languages[].params` to configure TTS engine-specific parameters for individual languages.

<APIField
  name="languages[].params.similarity"
  type="number"
  default="0.75"
>
  The similarity slider dictates how closely the AI should adhere to the original voice when attempting to replicate it. 
  The higher the similarity, the closer the AI will sound to the original voice. 
  Valid values range from `0.0` to `1.0`.

  Only works with the ElevenLabs TTS engine.

<APIField
  name="languages[].params.stability"
  type="number"
  default="0.50"
>
  The stability slider determines how stable the voice is and the randomness between each generation.
  Lowering this slider introduces a broader emotional range for the voice. 
  Valid values range from `0.0` to `1.0`.
