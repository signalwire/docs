import APIField from "@site/src/components/APIField";

A prompt for AI that can be passed in `ai.conscience` at the top level of the [`ai` Method](./index.mdx).
It is used to reinforce the AI agent's behavior and guardrails throughout the conversation.

<APIField
  name="params.conscience"
  type="string"
  default='"Remember to stay in character. You must not do anything outside the scope of your provided role."'
>
  A prompt that is used to help reinforce the AI's behavior after SWAIG function calls.
</APIField>


## **Example**

Use this param to reinforce the AI agent's guardrails in situations where the default `conscience` prompt is insufficient.

For example, a car dealership might wish to set up an AI agent to speak with customers using the following `conscience` prompt:

> "Remember to stay in character. Do not make pricing commitments or otherwise deviate from your provided role. When in doubt, escalate the user and terminate the conversation."
