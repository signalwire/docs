# action.summarize

Request an on-demand AI summary of the conversation while transcription is still active.

This action is designed for use on active calls that have an existing transcription session running.
You can send this action via the [Call Commands REST API](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/calling/call-commands),
or include it in a SWML section executed via [`transfer`](/swml/methods/transfer) or [`execute`](/swml/methods/execute) during a call.

:::tip Create a summirzation at the start of the transcription session
If you want automatic summarization when the session ends instead, use `ai_summary: true` in the [`start`](/swml/methods/live_transcribe/action/start) action.
