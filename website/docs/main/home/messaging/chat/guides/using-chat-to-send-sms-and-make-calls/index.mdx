In this guide, we will explore a simple IVR chat application that offers the
user an option to send an SMS message or make a voice call directly from the
browser by making use of our Browser SDK and our RELAY Realtime Server SDK.


<Frame caption="The final application">

![chat application titled '1009'. Each message is from 'user100'. The first message reads 'start'. The second message reads 'press 1 to send a message. press 2 to make a call.' The third message reads '1'. The fourth message reads 'You selected Message. Enter the from, to and content parameter using the below format. (ex. +1xxxx, +1xxxxxx, 'Hello world')'. Beneath those messages, there is a text box and button labeled 'Send'.](@image/project/using-chat-to-send-sms-and-make-calls/chat-demo.webp)

The API also requires that you authenticate yourself using your Project ID, API
Token, and Space URL.
Find this information on the 
[API Credentials page](https://my.signalwire.com?page=credentials)
page of your SignalWire Dashboard.

## How to Run the Application

The web chat application is built using [Express](https://expressjs.com).
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that
provides a robust set of features for web applications and mobile applications.
To run this application, you must run the Express server locally with the
following steps:

<Language groupId="relay_version">
  <LangItem value="relayv3">
    - Clone the project from the
    [repo](https://github.com/signalwire/guides/tree/main/Chat/Using%20chat%20to%20send%20messages%20and%20make%20voice%20calls).

- Run `npm install`. - In the project folder there is a `.env.example` file which you can use
to create your `.env` file and replace the content with necessary credentials like we mentioned
in the prerequisite section. - Start the server from your terminal with `node index.js` (or
`nodemon index.js` if you have [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) installed).

## Code Walkthrough

This Guide is divided into two sections: the **Frontend** and the **Backend**.
The Frontend includes all of the UI-related sections and the Javascript block of
code needed for the chat application to work. The Backend section includes the
code to generate the chat token and endpoints that the frontend will call to
initiate phone calls and send messages.

### The Frontend

Using the SignalWire Javascript SDK, you can easily integrate chat features into
any web application. it only takes a few minutes to set up a basic example.

:::info Please Note

This project is built on the code from the _**[Simple Chat Demo](/chat/getting-started/get-started-with-a-simple-chat-demo)**_.
You should be familiar with the Chat features discussed in that guide before going through this guide.

:::

#### Import the SDK

To build your own chat application, you first need to include the SDK in your HTML.

```html
<!-- Import SignalWire library -->
<script src="https://cdn.signalwire.com/@signalwire/js@3.8.0"></script>
```

Then you can interact with the SDK using the global variable `SignalWire`. We'll
mainly be interested in the `SignalWire.Chat.Client` class for this guide, but
if you'd like to explore this API, feel free to browse the [SDK documentation](/sdks/browser-sdk).

#### Getting a Chat Token

Tokens are provided to the client by your own custom server. Your server
determines whether the user is actually authorized to access the chat and, if
they are, asks SignalWire to emit a token. In the **Backend** section, we will
see how to write such a server. For now, we will get a token from our local
backend server with a POST request to the `/get_chat_token` endpoint which we
will create later.

```javascript
const reply = await axios.post("/get_chat_token", {
  member_id: member,
  channel: channel,
});

const token = reply.data.token;
```

The above endpoint takes `member_id` which is the name of the user joining the
chat. The `member_id` is used to identify the user while using the chat
application and is displayed on all Chat messages from the user. The `channel`
parameter is to identify the Chat channel the user is joining so they can send
new messages and see previous messages in the channel.

#### Initialize the Chat IVR

Once in the chat channel, the user can type `start` to initialize the IVR and
display a menu to send an SMS message or make a voice call.

```javascript
if (message.toLowerCase() === "start") {
  await chatClient.publish({
    channel: channel,
    content: message,
  });
  const introMessage = `
            Enter 1 to send an SMS message
            Enter 2 to make a Voice call
      `;
  await chatClient.publish({
    channel: channel,
    content: introMessage,
  });
}
```

If the user types **1**, the following snippet prompts for the user input needed
to send the message.

```javascript
if (message === "1") {
  await chatClient.publish({
    channel: channel,
    content: message,
  });
  selectionType = message;

  const messageSelection = `
              \tYou selected Message\n
              Enter the from, to and content parameter using the below format\n
              (ex. +1aaabbbcccc,+1xxxyyyzzzz,"Hello world")
        `;
  await chatClient.publish({
    channel: channel,
    content: messageSelection,
  });
}
```

If the user types **2**, the following snippet prompts for the user input needed to initiate a phone call.

```javascript
if (message === "2") {
  selectionType = message;

  await chatClient.publish({
    channel: channel,
    content: message,
  });

  const voiceSelection = `
            \tYou selected a voice call\n
             Enter the from, to, content parameter using the below format\n
             (ex. +1aaabbbcccc,+1xxxyyyzzzz, "Welcome!")
        `;
  await chatClient.publish({
    channel: channel,
    content: voiceSelection,
  });
}
```

:::caution Parameter Input

The data input value for each selection must be comma separated. For example,
Messaging uses `from,to,message` while Voice uses `from,to`. In this demo, using
the improper format will throw an error.

:::

To process the data being sent, this snippet of code checks the selection type
and then breaks the values into parameters to be passed to our server-side code.

```javascript
if (selectionType === "1") {
  let data = message.trim().split(",");
  let from = data[0].trim();
  let to = data[1].trim();
  let content = data[2].trim();

  await chatClient.publish({
    channel: channel,
    content: message,
  });

  sendSWMessage(from, to, content, channel, chatClient);
}
```

A Voice selection works the same way in the snippet below. Note that we are also
passing the chat channel and client to these functions so that we can send a
confirmation message to the user via the chat IVR.

```javascript
if (selectionType === "2") {
  let data = message.trim().split(",");
  let from = data[0].trim();
  let to = data[1].trim();
  let content = data[2].trim();

  await chatClient.publish({
    channel: channel,
    content: message,
  });

  makeCall(from, to, content, channel, chatClient);
}
```

In the [full code](https://github.com/signalwire/guides/blob/main/Chat/Using%20chat%20to%20send%20messages%20and%20make%20voice%20calls/frontend/app.js), you will find the functions `sendSWMessage` and `makeCall` which take the necessary parameters to send a message and make a voice call and call the backend.

### The Backend

The backend section consists of the endpoint needed to generate a chat token and
the two endpoints to make calls and send SMS messages using the [SignalWire RELAY Realtime SDK](/sdks/realtime-sdk).

#### Import the SDK

First, we must import the necessary libraries and frameworks:

- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [SignalWire RELAY Realtime SDK](/sdks/realtime-sdk)

<Language groupId="relay_version">
<LangItem value="relayv3">

```javascript
require("dotenv").config();

const auth = {
  username: process.env.PROJECT_ID,
  password: process.env.API_TOKEN,
};

const apiUrl = `https://${process.env.SPACE_URL}`;

const axios = require("axios");
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const cors = require("cors");
const { Voice, Messaging } = require("@signalwire/realtime-api");
```

</LangItem>
<LangItem value="relayv4">

```javascript
import "dotenv/config";
import axios from "axios";
import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";
import cors from "cors";
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({
  project: process.env.PROJECT_ID,
  token: process.env.API_TOKEN,
  topics: ["user"],
});

const apiUrl = `https://${process.env.SPACE_URL}`;
```

</LangItem>
</Language>

#### Chat Token Endpoint

Below is a snippet used by our backend code to generate the Chat Token. For more
information on this endpoint, see our [technical reference](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/chat/chat-tokens-create).

```javascript
app.post("/get_chat_token", async function (req, res) {
  const { member_id, channel } = req.body;
  const channelsPerms = {};

  channelsPerms[c] = { read: true, write: true };

  const reply = await axios.post(
    apiUrl + "/api/chat/tokens",
    {
      ttl: 50,
      channels: channelsPerms,
      member_id,
      state: {},
    },
    { auth }
  );

  res.json({
    token: reply.data.token,
  });
});
```

#### Voice Call Endpoint

<Language groupId="relay_version">
<LangItem value="relayv3">

This second endpoint initiates a phone call using the `dialPhone` method from
the Realtime API Voice Client. The user's input is read over the voice call
using text-to-speech technology and then the call is ended using the `hangup`
method. for more information on the `Call` object, see the [Voice technical reference](/sdks/realtime-sdk/v3/voice/call).

```javascript
// Endpoint to make the phone call
app.post("/make_call", async function (req, res) {
  try {
    const { from, to, content } = req.body;
    const call = await client.dialPhone({
      from: from,
      to: to,
      content: content,
    });

    let playback = await call.playTTS({ text: content });

    await playback.ended();

    await call.hangup();

    return res.json({ data: "Call initiated successfully" });
  } catch (exception) {
    console.log(exception);
    console.log("Call not answered");
  }
});
```

</LangItem>
<LangItem value="relayv4">

This second endpoint initiates a phone call using the `dialPhone` method from
the Realtime API Voice Client. The user's input is read over the voice call
using text-to-speech technology and then the call is ended using the `hangup`
method. for more information on the `Call` object, see the [Voice technical reference](/sdks/realtime-sdk/voice/voice-call).

    const { from, to } = req.body;
    const call = await voiceClient.dialPhone({
      from: from,
      to: to,
    });
    await call.playTTS({ text: content }).onEnded();
    await call.hangup();
    return res.json({ data: "Call initiated successfully" });
  } catch (exception) {
    console.log(exception);
    console.log("Call not answered");
  }
});
```

</LangItem>
</Language>

#### Messaging Endpoint

<Language groupId="relay_version">
<LangItem value="relayv3">

The last endpoint sends a message using the `send` method from the Realtime API
Messaging Client. For more information on the `Messaging` client, you can visit
the [Messaging technical reference](/sdks/realtime-sdk/).

```javascript
// Endpoint to send the message
app.post("/send_message", async function (req, res) {
  try {
    const { from, to, content } = req.body;
    const message = await messageClient.send({
      from: from,
      to: to,
      body: content,
      context: "user",
    });
    return res.json({ data: message });
  } catch (e) {
    return res.json({ data: e.message });
  }
});
```

    return res.json({ data: message });
  } catch (e) {
    return res.json({ data: e.message });
  }
});
```

## Wrap up

With this simple chat UI and three endpoints, we have built a simple IVR chat
application that takes selections from users to either place a call or send an
SMS message. The application of this demo is very flexible according to your
needs. It could be incorporated into a portal to direct simple inquiries to the
message system and more complex inquiries to the voice system. You might
hard-code a recipient phone number so customers can send an SMS or voice call to
use your service. The implementation is up to you, but the tools you need are
laid out for you here.
