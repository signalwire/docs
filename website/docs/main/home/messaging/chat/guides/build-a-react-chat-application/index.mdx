# Building Chat Apps with React

When building a frontend communication application, you have probably had to deal with a plethora of complicated details like setting up or renting your own communication infrastructure, making sense of the ever-elusive WebRTC specs and implementations, making sure everything is scalable, supports all major browsers, and so much more. In this guide, we will walk through how to use SignalWire Chat JS SDK integrated with React, a popular frontend framework, to create a robust IP message Chat application.

The application has three chat channels: Office, Book Club, and Workshop. Several sample messages from different users are shown. There is a text box and a Send button." />

## The Frontend

We have prepared a simple live example which will be the reference implementation for this guide. Please check out the [Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-chat-ep9x75?file=/src/pages/Home.js). You can also find the same sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/signalwire/simple-chat-in-react/tree/main/frontend).

### Components

The demo is built with two simple pages, with the home page constructed with two components.  
 This guide will reference these components:

- the **Login** page where the user will input a username and channels to subscribe to;
- the **Home** page which shows a channel list on the left and messages from the active channel on the right;
- the **Sidenav** component which displays all of the subscribed channels and tracks the active channel;
- the **Channel** component which diplays the messages sent to the active channel and a text area for a user's new message input.

The pages folder includes Home.js and Login.js."

### Connection

To connect to the SignalWire API and make this framework functional, you must include the SDK in your HTML.

```html
<!-- Import SignalWire library -->
<script src="https://cdn.signalwire.com/@signalwire/js@3"></script>
```

If you prefer, you can install the npm package `@signalwire/js`.

With either alternative, you can now `import {Chat} from "@signalwire/js"` and access it in your components. We'll mainly be interested in the `Chat.Client` class for this guide, but if you'd like to explore this API, please browse the [SDK documentation](/sdks/browser-sdk).

We will start in the **Login** component by obtaining an authentication token and instantiating a `Client` object. The `Client` constructor takes a `token` parameter. This is an authentication token that defines (among other things) the channels which the client is allowed to read and write. To subscribe to channels in the Home component, you must ensure that the channels you're subscribing to are allowed by the token you obtain here.

```javascript
const reply = await axios.post(SERVERLOCATION + "/get_chat_token", {
  member_id,
  channels,
});

const chatClient = new Chat.Client({
  token: reply.data.token,
});
```

Notice that when we request a token, we specify a member_id (which can be any unique string of your choice) in addition to the list of allowed channels. This interface is not specific to the SignalWire SDK: when you write your own server, you will be free to specify any parameters you need for the `/get_chat_token` endpoint.

:::info How to obtain a token?

Tokens are provided to the client by your custom server. Your server determines whether the user is authorized to access the chat and, if they are, asks SignalWire to emit a token. For demo purposes, you can obtain a public access token from our demo server. To do so, set `SERVERLOCATION` to `https://2u5lf.sse.codesandbox.io:8080`. If you would like to build your own backend for a production-quality application, see the [Backend](#the-backend) section for guidance.

:::

After we successfully create the Chat Client, we use the `App.js` wrapper to pass `username`, `channels`, and `chatClient` to the **Home** component.

### Subscribing to Channels, Loading Message History, and Listening for New Messages

Over in the **Home** component, we will use the list of desired channels to display a list of buttons in the **Sidenav** component to allow the user to switch between channels. We will subscribe to the active channel and download existing messages, and listen for new messages in the **Channel** component.

Here is where the power of React comes into play. We will use a useEffect hook to subscribe, retrieve messages, and listen for new messages whenever the user selects a new channel. Because useEffect doesnâ€™t accept asynchronous functions, we need to define and call the async function inside the hook. The default on the first load will be the first channel on the channel list.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const onLoad = async () => {
    // Initially, we don't strictly need the 'off' or 'unsubscribe'
    // but it's necessary to clean up before switching to the new channel
    chatClient.off("message");
    chatClient.on("message", (message) => {
      setMessages((oldMessages) => [...oldMessages, message]);
    });
    try {
      await chatClient.unsubscribe(channels);
    } catch (_) {}
    await chatClient.subscribe(selectedChannel);

    const messageHistory = await chatClient.getMessages({
      channel: selectedChannel,
    });

    if (messageHistory?.messages) {
      setMessages(messageHistory.messages.reverse());
    }
  };

  onLoad();
}, [chatClient, selectedChannel]);
```

:::caution Cleanup

Note that it is important to unsubscribe from old channels before subscribing to a new active channel. If you skip this step, you may end up receiving events and displaying messages from multiple channels.

:::

### Sending Messages

The last element on our frontend is allowing the user to send a message to the active channel. We can do this with the `publish` method on the Chat Client object:

```js
const publishMessage = async () => {
  await chatClient.publish({
    channel: selectedChannel,
    content,
  });
  setMessage("");
};
```

Although we've set our default message state as a string, your message doesn't necessarily have to be a string. It can be any JSON-serializable object!

## The Backend

Even though SignalWire provides the platform for all chat communications when using the Chat APIs, you still need to write some server-side logic to proxy the SignalWire REST APIs. Your server-side script should work to authenticate your users, manage their permissions, and relay the tokens from the SignalWire's Chat REST APIs to the client's browser. The token has information like the `member_id` (which we call username in the UI) and the channel permissions for the token's user. The JavaScript SDK running in the client's browser will then use the token to establish a direct connection with the SignalWire servers.

We prepared a live sample proxy server on [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/chat-backend-uh78zo?file=/index.js). This is the server that supports the frontend linked above. It is a fairly simple setup:

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const auth = {
  username: process.env.PROJECT_ID, // Project-ID
  password: process.env.API_KEY, // API token
};
const apiurl = "https://" + process.env.SPACE_URL;

const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const cors = require("cors");
const axios = require("axios");

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(cors());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  if (
    auth.username === undefined ||
    auth.password === undefined ||
    auth.username === "" ||
    auth.password === ""
  )
    return res.send(
      "Hello. My environment variables are not set.<br/> Please set them from your SignalWire Space."
    );
  else return res.send("Hello. I'm alive");
});

// Endpoint to request token for chat token
app.post("/get_chat_token", async (req, res) => {
  const { member_id, channels } = req.body;

  const channelsPerms = {};
  for (const c of channels) {
    channelsPerms[c] = { read: true, write: true };
  }
  try {
    const reply = await axios.post(
      apiurl + "/api/chat/tokens",
      {
        ttl: 50,
        channels: channelsPerms,
        member_id,
        state: {},
      },
      { auth }
    );

    res.json({
      token: reply.data.token,
    });
  } catch (e) {
    //console.log(e);
    console.log(JSON.stringify(e));
    return res.sendStatus(500);
  }
});

async function start(port) {
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log("Server listening at port", port);
  });
}

start(8080);
```

The source above is all it takes to write a functional backend for the Chat application. At the most basic level, it has to provide a single endpoint (here named /get_chat_token) that takes the username, and the requested chat channels and returns a JWT token. The client-side SDK will handle the rest.

### Permissions

As you can see in the proxy server code, our example requests read and write permissions on all channels requested on the token. When you build your server, you can design your authorization scheme to limit permissions for each user. As we discussed in the Frontend section, it is important to include these permissions in order to interact with the channels the user subscribes to.

### Authentication

If you have used SignalWire APIs before, you are already familiar with the three pieces of information you need to access the APIs:

- **PROJECT_ID** identifies the project that SignalWire will bill.
- **API_KEY** is a secret token string generated via the SignalWire Dashboard that can restrict access to a specific SignalWire product. Keeping this a secret is the main reason you need to write a proxy server to conceal it from the browser.
- **SPACE_URL** is a URL in the format `{your username}.signalwire.com`. You will use this URL to access all SignalWire REST APIs.

The SignalWire REST APIs use basic authentication with the Project ID as username and the API Token as the password. Axios makes it easier by simply accepting an auth object, which it will concatenate and encode in base 64 to create a basic authentication token. The REST API endpoints are accessed through your Space URL. See more information on the endpoints in the [SignalWire API reference](/rest).

## Wrap Up

That's all it takes to develop your Chat application with React. We built a standalone chat application, but you can incorporate these methods and components in your larger applications.
