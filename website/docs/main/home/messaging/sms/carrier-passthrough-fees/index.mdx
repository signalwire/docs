# Carrier passthrough fees

## Overview

U.S. and Canadian carriers apply **per-segment** surcharges or fees to A2P (Application-to-Person) traffic.
These fees are charged by carriers (like AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon) for **sending or receiving** SMS and MMS messages on their networks. 

Fees vary by carrier, message type (SMS or MMS), and direction (inbound or outbound).

- **Inbound / Mobile Originating (MO):** Messages *received by* SignalWire phone numbers
- **Outbound / Mobile Terminating (MT):** Messages *sent by* SignalWire phone numbers

SignalWire passes on carrier-imposed surcharges at-cost, with no additional markup. The tables below outline current rates, subject to change based on carrier updates.
