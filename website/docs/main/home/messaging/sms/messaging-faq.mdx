# Messaging FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the essential steps I need to take to start sending messages?">

1. Create a Brand.
2. Register a Campaign.
3. Assign phone numbers to the campaign.

Full details are explained in our [Registration](/messaging/getting-started/campaign-registry/registration) guide.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is 10DLC?">

10DLC is a type of phone number. Short for 10 Digit Local Code, it is a type of phone number
that includes an area code followed by 7 additional digits indicating a specific channel.
For example, +12345678910, where the "+1" indicates the country, the "234" indicates the
area code, and the remaining digits indicate the channel.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between 10DLC and Toll-free phone numbers?">

Toll-free numbers, although slightly more expensive, allow for increased throughput out-of-the-box.
They also have a registration process tied to them, however once complete, have a higher
deliverability rating than traditional 10DLC numbers.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is The Campaign Registry?">

The Campaign Registry is a platform that was created in partnership with a company called
Kaleyra and several Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). The platform itself acts as a source
of information about every 10DLC number being used for outbound SMS through A2P routes in
an effort to discourage spam in the industry. In short, any and all 10DLC numbers that are
to be used for SMS in SignalWire's platform must be registered through the Campaign Registry.
You can find more information about the Campaign Registry in-depth [here](/messaging/get-started/campaign-registry).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can we programmatically create campaigns and brands?">

Yes! You can do this through the SignalWire REST APIs. Check out the [documentation](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/list-brands).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many messages can I send out?">

The number of messages you can send out depends on a few different factors. If you are using
a toll-free number, there is no real limit outside of throughput in regards to the amount
of messages you could feasibly send. With 10DLC, it depends on your registered use case with
the Campaign Registry. AT&T provides limits a limit on the amount of texts per minute you
can send to an end-user at the campaign level whereas T-Mobile limits the overall amount
of SMS per day you can send to and end user at the brand level. For more information around
this, feel free to read [Campaign Registry - All you need to know](/messaging/get-started/campaign-registry).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What content is not allowed?">

There is some content that is explicitly disallowed from being sent via SMS/MMS with SignalWire.
You can see this list in full detail [here](./getting-started/sms-best-practices-how-to-ensure-message-delivery.mdx).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are NAFs?">

Network Access Fees (NAFs) are additional fees that are charged by Mobile Network Operators
(MNOs) charge on a per-SMS/MMS basis for the ability of that SMS/MMS to be passed-through
their network.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are all the NAFs the same?">

No. Every MNO has their own NAFs set by them for inbound and outbound SMS. To see a list
of NAFs broken down by MNO and direction, you can look [here](/messaging/getting-started/campaign-registry/pricing).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get higher throughput?">

For verified toll-free numbers, you can contact sales at sales@signalwire.com to increase
the throughput of those numbers up to 100 MPS for an additional price.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I just send SMS/MMS to a specific carrier like Verizon?">

SignalWire does not provide a way to explicitly send to Verizon end-users or end-users of
any other MNO.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I register toll-free SMS/MMS traffic?">

You can verify toll-free traffic by opening a support ticket with us. Our team will follow
up with the forms and information we need from you within that support ticket.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does SignalWire manage opt-outs?">

No. Customers are responsible for handling inbound stop requests and removing those customers
from subscriber lists. Messages should **not** go out to these numbers again unless they
have opted back in via an Unstop request.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is considered a high opt-out rate?">

Carriers consider anything more than 5% opt-out to be a high rate for consumers who have
opted in and therefore should want to receive these messages.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title = "Can I turn off inbound SMS?">

Not currently. We have no way to turn off inbound SMS at this time. You can leave your numbers
unset up for messaging and nothing will happen when inbound messages come into the numbers
though!

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you have a messaging queue?">

We do not have a "scheduled" queue, but messages that exceed your throughput will be entered
into your space's backlog and sent when possible. Read about the backlog and queue system
[here](/platform/basics/general/signalwire-rate-limits#queue-and-backlog-system)! The default
message backlog is 10,000 for the entire Space. These limits can be increased based on
the use case and individual approval following an [account verification request](/platform/dashboard/guides/how-to-request-an-increase-to-your-signalwire-space-limits).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Am I billed once a message is in the queue?">

  Messages are charged when they are 'Sent' successfully - meaning they leave our network without
  issue. They are charged regardless of whether or not they deliver after they have left our
  network. You are not charged while your messages are queued or 'failed' (failed meaning they
  never left our network).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I find information on specific error codes?">

Visit our [error code explanation page](/rest/compatibility-api/overview/error-codes) for details. Also, to find out what you can do about error codes, take a look at [How to Troubleshoot Common Messaging Issues](./getting-started/how-to-troubleshoot-common-messaging-issues.mdx).
