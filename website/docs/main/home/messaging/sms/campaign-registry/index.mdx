# The Campaign Registry

<Subtitle>Everything you need to know</Subtitle>

<br/><br/>

If you're using an application platform (e.g. SignalWire) to send customers messages from a local phone number, 
you need to register with the Campaign Registry regardless of your use case. 
In this guide, we will walk you through what the Campaign Registry is and why is it important to register.

:::info Sharing What we Know

The Campaign Registry only applies to 10DLC/local numbers sending messages to local US phone numbers. **If you are sending messaging exclusively outside of the US or only from toll-free/shortcode numbers, this guide is not for you!**

These pages containing an overview of TCR rules and regulations and FAQs illustrate SignalWire's most current understanding of carrier plans. Many of these details are still being finalized and could be subject to change, however SignalWire will continue to update this information as TCR evolves.

## What is the Campaign Registry?

The usage of extended codes for messaging campaigns has increased due to their simplicity and ability to meet the needs of Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging between businesses and customers. As text message volume has increased, some businesses have used the same technology for sending spam text messages. This proliferation of spam is bad for customers, businesses, and the mobile industry overall.

With the above in mind, the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) have partnered up with a company called Kaleyra to create The Campaign Registry. This platform is a single source of information about 10DLC messaging campaigns throughout the U.S., enabling the MNOs to serve as a record of who sent any given 10DLC message and what they claim to be sending, which can be checked and validated against actual messaging behavior.

The Campaign Registry is about creating a centralized, trusted access point to key information enabling messaging service providers such as SignalWire, to exchange transparency (directly with the MNO’s) in who they are and what they are doing for more predictable and reliable service delivery to end-users.

MNO's can now have visibility into the “who” and “what” of each messaging campaign which allows them to provide a better quality of service for 10DLC messaging, while service providers like SignalWire can have confidence knowing that they are using an officially sanctioned messaging channel. Businesses can finally benefit from a better quality of service as well as better predictability of success for your messaging campaigns.

## How is SignalWire involved?

SignalWire is proud to be at the forefront of these changes by working with all of our partners within this new communications ecosystem since its inception. Our priority is ensuring that your business is thriving and there is no disruption. We are fully committed to providing you with these updates as they are received and assisting you with adapting whatever changes are needed.

We will help you register and get your numbers and messaging verified with the registry, and navigate you through all the changes.

## Who needs to register?

If you're using an application platform to send messages to the customers, **regardless of the conversational nature of the use case**, then it is considered A2P (Application-to-Person) and you **need** to register. In other words, if you are using SignalWire to send messages to customers, you need to register your brand, campaigns, and phone numbers. 

:::warning mandatory registration
Registering with the Campaign Registry is mandatory for **all 10DLC traffic to US numbers**.
:::

Brands registering with The Campaign Registry will have their legal company name, legal company address, and EIN/Tax ID checked against multiple databases, resulting in either a **Verified** or **Unverified** status. Any brand marked Unverified can update their details and resubmit to The Campaign Registry. Each submission incurs a `$4` charge.

Given the way that each brand is viewed, every brand that is registered must have a **unique EIN**. This means that no two brands may share the same EIN or you will risk damaging your companies trust score.

## Terms to know

There are four categories of players involved in this ecosystem -

- **MNO** - These are the Mobile Network Operators aka wireless carriers (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, etc.). These are the companies that deliver your messages to the End Users.
- **DCA** (Direct Connect Aggregators) - These companies directly connect to the MNO’s gateways and transmit messages on behalf of its customers, such as SignalWire.
- **CSP** - This Is SignalWire - A Campaign Service Provider provides messaging services to its customers. A CSP works with its customers (aka Brands) to create and launch new and successful messaging campaigns. SignalWire is a fully registered CSP!
- **Brands** - This is the company or entity that will be sending the messages to its End Users.

## Registration best practices

<Steps>

### Be transparent and honest
You do not want to be in a situation where you are flagged for an error in your brand information or other information requested. More information on this is below.

### Provide clarity and detail

We advise you to be clear and detailed, especially for special use cases. 
Your use case is what you are using that campaign for. 
This lets the MNOs know what type of messaging to expect. 
Here’s a list of the use cases that you can select from.
When reviewing a campaign, carriers will look at the campaign description and see if it matches the content of the messages being sent.

### Provide message templates 

To verify that your use case is what you say it is, the registry also asks for messages or message templates that you would be sending. Even if you do not expect to have standard messages, try coming up with a few of your most common scenarios, especially if you are going to use the campaign for some common use cases, to help the registry judge your validity. Opt-out language is a must!

</Steps>

:::info Phone Number Assignments Completion Time

When you create a phone number assignment for a brand new campaign, SignalWire has to send information up to our carriers in order to get it connected on their end. **For a brand new campaign, this process can take up to 24 hours in normal circumstances.** You may see failed or pending for the number assignment order during this time. Rest assured that as soon as it's completed on the carrier end, you will see it reflected in your portal!
