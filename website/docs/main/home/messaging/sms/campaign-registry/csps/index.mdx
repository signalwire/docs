# Campaign Service Providers (CSPs)

<Subtitle>The Campaign Registry</Subtitle>


:::warning Do I need to be a CSP?
If you intend to only create a few Brands and Campaigns then you may choose to have SignalWire act as your CSP and submit your Messaging Campaign Applications on your behalf.
If this describes your messaging intentions then you can learn about registering your Brand and Campaigns [**here**](../registration/index.mdx).
:::

Before digging too deep into acronyms and terms about The Campaign Registry, please reference the 
[Campaign Registry - Everything You Need to Know](/messaging/get-started/campaign-registry) 
guide for more background on the policies put into place for 10 Digit Long Code Messaging.

As an ISV (Independent Software Vendor), you have a customer base that each needs their own unique Brand and Campaign registration.
As organizing your campaigns becomes increasingly complex, it may be time to look into managing your own campaigns by communicating with The Campaign Registry directly. 
A Campaign Service Provider has the ability to register or modify their own Brands and Campaigns without needing to involve SignalWire until it is time to associate the newly registered Brands and Campaigns.


## How to become a CSP and Getting Started

The first step in becoming a Campaign Service Provider will be to [Register with The Campaign Registry](https://csp.campaignregistry.com/register)

Next, you will need to Create a Brand within the Campaign Registry CSP Portal. 
The initial step for Campaign Registration will be to create a Brand. 
The information entered will be submitted for Brand Identity Verification so it is important that each field is correctly filled out. 
This will save time and also save you from pulling your hair out later.

After creating a Brand, you will need to Create a Campaign. 
A Campaign is a specific use case of your Brand that gives more information on the content that is being sent.

Although the creation of a Brand and Campaign can be done through the CSP Campaign Registry Portal, you are also able to automate this process through the usage of the 
[Campaign Registry APIs](https://csp-api.campaignregistry.com/v2/restAPI). 
These REST APIs can be easily incorporated into whatever environment your system is based in.

## Associating your Brand and Campaigns with SignalWire
Once you have created your Brands and Campaigns via The Campaign Registry Dashboard or API, first you must select SignalWire as your upstream Connectivity Partner (CNP), and then you must send Brand and Campaign information directly to SignalWire so your phone numbers can be connected to the newly registered Campaigns. 
In summary, you provide specific information about the new Brand and Campaign either via Dashboard or API, we review and accept the connection request, and then our upstream Direct Connect Aggregator (DCA) vets and accepts the connection request. 
Once the DCA election is completed, you may begin assigning your SignalWire phone numbers to your new Campaign!


### Associating your Brand and Campaigns with SignalWire via Dashboard
If you choose to do this through the Dashboard, you can navigate to **Messaging Campaigns** and then **Create a partner brand**.
After entering in your _name_ and _CSP brand reference_ via API or Dashboard, you will see your Partner Brand appear in the Dashboard.

</figure>

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-800"
    src={require("./Step_2.webP").default}
    alt="A screenshot of the Add a Brand page. Blue buttons allow the user to continue adding a Managed Brand or Create a Partner Brand instead."
  />
</figure>

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-800"
    src={require("./Step_3.webP").default}
    alt="A screenshot of the Add Partner Brand page. The user can add the name of the brand and reference ID, and then click the Blue button to finish adding the brand."
  />
</figure>

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-800"
    src={require("./Step_4.webP").default}
    alt="A screenshot of the Success page for adding a Partner Brand. A blue button allows the user to continue the process."
  />
</figure>

<br />

After associating your Brands, you must [Create Self-Registered Campaigns](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/create-campaign) underneath the Brands that you have created.
Again, this can be done via API through the usage of REST APIs, or, can be done through the SignalWire Dashboard underneath the **Messaging Campaigns** tab.

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-800"
    src={require("./Step_5.webP").default}
    alt="A screenshot of the Start a Messaging Campaign page, showing the steps the user has already completed and what is ahead. A blue button allows the user to move on to Register a Campaign."
  />
</figure>

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-800"
    src={require("./Step_6.webP").default}
    alt="A screenshot of the Register Campaign page. The user has a selection input to select the Brand, and a blue button to continue."
  />
</figure>

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-800"
    src={require("./Step_7.webP").default}
    alt="A screenshot of the Add CSP Campaign page. The user can add the name of the Campaign and the Reference ID, and then click the Blue button to finish adding the campaign."
  />
</figure>

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-800"
    src={require("./Step_8.webP").default}
    alt="A screenshot of the Success page for adding a CSP Campaign. A blue button allows the user to continue the process."
  />
</figure>

<br />

For the final step, you must [Create a Phone Number Assignment](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/create-order) to associate your Self-Registered Campaign to your SignalWire Phone number.
Navigate to the _Campaign Phone Numbers_ section of the _Messaging Campaigns_ tab in your Dashboard to manually complete this process, or use our 
[REST API](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/create-order).

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-800"
    src={require("./Step_9.webP").default}
    alt="A screenshot of the Start a Messaging Campaign page, showing the steps the user has already completed and what is ahead. A blue button allows the user to move on to Assign Phone Numbers."
  />
</figure>

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-800"
    src={require("./Step_10.webP").default}
    alt="A screenshot of the Assign Phone Numbers page. The user has a selection input to select the Campaign, and a blue button to continue."
  />
</figure>

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-800"
    src={require("./Step_11.webP").default}
    alt="A screenshot of the Assign Phone Numbers selection page. It has two lists of numbers: on the left, the list of purchased numbers, and on the right, the list of numbers to be assigned to the campaign. Blue buttons to move numbers to the 'to be assigned' column allow the user to select which numbers to assign to the campaign. Once done, the user can press the blue 'Finish' button to complete the process."
  />
</figure>

<br />

Please note that if the Brand and Campaign are not loaded into your SignalWire Space, phone numbers will not be able to associate with the Campaign and you will not be able to send messages.

## DCA Election: The Final Step

You, like many others, may think that you should be able to start sending messages immediately upon Campaign registration.
However, something commonly overlooked is the fact that The Campaign Registry is simply a registration database that contains information for entities (such as mobile operators, DCA’s, CNP’s, and CSP’s) to reference. 

What this means is that the information your customers provide in their Campaign registration will need to be validated and vetted. 
Since you can realistically input anything in a Campaign registration, it’s not only our duty (and the DCA’s duty) to ensure that each and every registration follows 
[CTIA guidelines](https://www.ctia.org/the-wireless-industry/industry-commitments/messaging-interoperability-sms-mms), but it is the duty of you as the ISV (Independent Software Vendor) to vet your own customers and the information they provide for the registrations.

You should know that our DCA is pretty strict with what they will and won’t allow on their platform. 
Their vetting practices are thorough, and we recommend that you take a look at our guide for 
[Upstream Campaign Vetting](https://signalwire.com/blogs/industry/campaign-vetting-tips-for-tcr). 
We also suggest reviewing our list of 
[Explicitly Prohibited Content](../../getting-started/sms-best-practices-how-to-ensure-message-delivery.mdx#explicitly-prohibited-content) 
to ensure your customers’ use cases will be able to send messages through our platform.

DCA election can take an additional 24 hours or more after you initially connect your Campaign to your SignalWire Space. 
The sooner you load your Campaign into your Space, the better. 
SignalWire will not request DCA election until after we have been alerted that a new Campaign needs to be connected, and the Campaign has been loaded into the SignalWire Space.

During DCA election vetting, the DCA will be checking to ensure there is a valid website that showcases who exactly is sending messages, the quality of the registration itself, and if the registration follows 
[CTIA guidelines](https://www.ctia.org/the-wireless-industry/industry-commitments/messaging-interoperability-sms-mms). 
Rejections can occur if insufficient information has been provided, and a resubmission fee of $7.50 will be applied upon resubmission.

## The Campaign Registry Fees

The movement to prevent unwanted messaging content involves a lot of engineering power and is quite costly. 
This pushes some of the cost down to the individual CSPs, as broken down in the table below. 
Luckily, SignalWire understands that these fees are enough of a burden for you, and we do not add on any other costs to associate with us. 
All of these fees will be handled between you and The Campaign Registry.

<figure>
  <img 
    className="img-800" 
    src={require("./pricing.webP").default} 
    alt="A diagram of The Campaign Registry fees information. Under 'General Fees', CSP Registration is one-time $200 fee. Brand Registration costs $4 per submission. A range of monthly fees between $1.50 and $30 are described within the 'Campaigns' section. Within 'Vetting', a standard vet costs $40, an enhanced vet costs $95, a political vet costs $64 with standard PIN delivery or $91.95 for express mail PIN delivery, and failed vets are assessed a $5 fee (or a $22 fee for political vets). " 
  />
</figure>

In addition to TCR's fees, our DCA (Direct Connect Aggregator, aka companies that provide direct connectivity to mobile carrier gateways for the purpose of delivering messages) has begun charging a **$7.50 vetting fee** to cover their costs of vetting each new Campaign when they receive a new Campaign connection request. 
This new vetting process has increased the registration turnaround time to a _minimum of 48 hours_. 
Providing insufficient information in the Campaign registration can cause significant delays. 
If our upstream partner requires additional information, another $7.50 re-vetting fee will be charged with each resubmission. 
You will be notified if re-vetting applies to your Campaign(s).

:::tip
We suggest that sufficient information is provided when registering your Campaign(s). 
This includes a FULL, formal description, up to 5 messaging templates, and if registering directly through SignalWire, a full description of the subscriber opt-in/opt-out process.

[Campaign Registry - Pricing page](/messaging/getting-started/campaign-registry/pricing).

## Unique Use Cases

Not all Messaging use cases are as cookie-cutter as The Campaign Registry would like them to be. 
That is alright; there are avenues created to address this.

If your campaign cannot be accurately placed in any specific use case, there are two solutions to allow unique use cases through either a _Mixed_ use case or a _Low Volume Mixed_ use case. 
The low volume mixed use case only costs $1.50 per month. 
It works great if you do not exceed 15,000 messages/ month and do not exceed 75 transactions per minute.
