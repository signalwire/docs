# Hosted messaging

Hosted Messaging allows you to use SignalWire to send and receive SMS and MMS on VoIP phone numbers that are held elsewhere for voice (such as a PBX or VoIP provider).
This enables you to migrate to SignalWire's robust Messaging capabilities
while maintaining your existing voice infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

* A Letter of Authorization (LOA) signed and dated by the authorized user or administrator of the number within the past 30 days
* A recent invoice from the current voice provider showing the phone number in service
* Permission from your current voice provider to split messaging services away from voice services

## Instructions

<Steps>

### Verify ownership of the phone number

Before SignalWire can host messaging, we must verify that you have ownership and authorization to text enable the phone number(s).

:::important
You must keep voice services active with the current voice provider in order to host messaging services with SignalWire. 
Releasing the phone number with the voice provider could result in disruption of messaging services.
:::

:::warning
Mobile phone numbers cannot have messaging services hosted with SignalWire.

**Required Information:**

* **Contact Name**  
* **Contact Email**  
* **Project ID**  
* **Numbers to Port (E.164)**  
* **Services to Port:** *Messaging Services Only*  
* **10DLC Campaign ID**

* **Account Type**  
* **Authorized Name on the Account**  
* **Billing Phone Number**

* **Invoice**

**Attention:** Standard Hosted Messaging requests submitted outside of the process outlined in this guide will not be processed,
and you will be instructed to return to your Dashboard to submit the order properly. 
SignalWire does not currently offer an API for porting submissions.

### Order processing and configuration

Once your request is received:

1. SignalWire will review the documentation provided and will add the phone number to your account.  
2. SignalWire will submit the order to host messaging services. There is a 48 hour minimum turnaround time for message enablement processing. During this time, messaging services should still process through the voice provider or current messaging service provider.  
3. Once the phone numbers are added to your dashboard, [setup your Inbound Message Settings](https://developer.signalwire.com/messaging/getting-started/receiving-your-first-sms/). You won’t be able to test right away, as the hosted messaging request is still processing.  
4. 10DLC Campaign provisioning (for US numbers only) begins once the messaging services have been enabled. This process may take 10-30 minutes. During this provisioning step, **outbound messaging will not function.**   
5. Once SignalWire confirms message enablement, test inbound and outbound functionality.

</Steps>

:::important
10DLC Campaign provisioning is required for all US VoIP phone numbers that need to send outbound messages to the US. 
Consult our [reference to 10DLC Campaigns](https://signalwire.com/blogs/industry/a-beginners-guide-to-a2p-10dlc-campaign-registration)
for more information.
Please ensure that your 10DLC Campaign is in an active state with SignalWire before requesting to host your messaging services.
