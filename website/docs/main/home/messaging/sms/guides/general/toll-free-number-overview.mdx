# Toll-free verification

## Overview

<div className="row">
  
  <div className="col col--8">

  Toll-free numbers are a great alternative to messaging with Short Code or 10DLC (local area code) numbers.
  In the US, toll-free numbers can be used for business messaging to all major US carriers, as well as most major mobile Canadian carriers.
  
    :::info

    All toll-free numbers must be verified prior to sending messages.

As a rule of thumb, some [categories of messaging are forbidden](/messaging/getting-started/sms-best-practices-how-to-ensure-message-delivery) on SignalWire. 
Please take the time to review our list of explicitly prohibited content before submitting your application for Toll-Free, 10DLC, and Short Code.

Downstream message filtering is designed to prevent unwanted messaging, fraud, and abuse. 
Before considering verifying your Toll-Free number, please be sure to follow the 
[CTIA guidelines and best messaging practices](https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/230523-CTIA-Messaging-Principles-and-Best-Practices-FINAL.pdf).

### Requirements

The following standards must be followed for Toll-Free messaging:

- **Obtain clear opt-in consent** from your recipients before sending messages
- **Enable easy opt-out** for message recipients
- **Avoid using shortened URLs** 
  - It's highly recommended to use a full branded URL as well as URLs that lead back to a legitimate website that contains branding, a privacy policy, terms of service, and contact information. 
    Publicly hosted URL shorteners are forbidden and are guaranteed to cause spam blocks.
- Using multiple Toll-Free numbers to send the same or similar content to bypass throughput limitations is known as **snowshoeing**. This is **highly prohibited** by carriers. If you need to [increase your throughput](https://signalwire.com/products/cloud-messaging/high-throughput-messaging#:~:text=With%20SignalWire%20High-Throughput%20Messaging,with%20Toll-Free%20numbers%20only), it can be approved by our Sales team. If you have a valid use case for using multiple Toll-Free numbers (such as multiple locations all requiring an individual Toll-Free number), this is something we may be able to work out with our carriers.

## Verification process {#get-verified}

Getting your Toll-Free number verified means that your business and use case has been reviewed and vetted prior to sending messaging via Toll-Free and that your content has received carrier approval.

There is no charge associated with the verification process.

Having your Toll-Free numbers verified will greatly reduce the risk of spam filtering on Toll-Free traffic towards all major mobile carriers in the US, as well as most major mobile carriers in Canada.
Make sure you stick to the content you submitted for verification and continue to follow SignalWire's 
[messaging best practices](https://signalwire.com/resources/guides/a2p-messaging-use-case-best-practices) and 
[code of conduct](https://signalwire.com/legal/messaging-code-of-conduct). 
Deviation from your verification registration can still result in spam filtering. **Verified does not mean whitelisted.** 

Verification affects messaging to mobile subscribers in the United States as well as Fido, Rogers, Telus, and Videotron in Canada.

Note: Other (non-US/Canada) countries do not treat Toll-Free SMS any differently than other international SMS, and you should consult that country's SMS Guidelines page to learn more about compliance considerations for messaging.
