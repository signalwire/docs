## Advanced Search

If you're okay with any number, you can simply select **Buy** on the first one that catches your eye. 
However, in most cases, there are specific area codes or regions that you are looking for.

The search filter tools allow you to narrow down your search by including area code, region, or region & city. 
You can also tell the search to return all numbers that contain, start with, or end with a certain sequence of numbers, or even a word. 

Once you find the number you want, simply select **Buy**.

## Phone Number Configuration

Congratulations, you purchased a phone number!

You'll now see the **Edit** page for the phone number.
If you'd like, you can now configure its Voice, Fax, and Messaging settings.
