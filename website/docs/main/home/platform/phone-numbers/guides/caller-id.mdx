### Verified Caller ID vs. SignalWire Phone Number

There are two types of phone numbers that are listed within your SignalWire project: SignalWire phone numbers and verified caller ID numbers.

**SignalWire Phone Numbers**

SignalWire phone numbers are purchased on your SignalWire Dashboard or through the REST API. 
SignalWire will operate these numbers on your behalf. 
SignalWire has a regular, recurring charge for these numbers and their usage. 
Your account will be billed monthly for each of your purchased phone numbers. 
SignalWire phone number capabilities, like Phone Calls, SMS, MMS, and Fax, are visible to you before you purchase a phone number. 
They will also be listed next to each of the numbers in the Phone Numbers menu of your SignalWire Space once you have purchased them.

**Verified Phone Numbers**

Verified phone numbers are numbers that you already own (i.e. the phone number for your wireless phone or landline for your office or home). 
These numbers are not ported to SignalWire and you will continue to be serviced by the original provider. 
SignalWire will not charge for these numbers. 
However, SignalWire will charge for the usage attributed with these numbers in the SignalWire network. 
Phone numbers that are verified on the SignalWire network can only be used with SignalWire as a caller ID for placing outbound calls.

### Setting Up Verified Caller ID for Outbound Calls

SignalWire offers a process to verify numbers not purchased with SignalWire, to be able to make outbound voice calls. 
Here are steps to verify these numbers in the SignalWire Space:

1. On the SignalWire Dashboard, click on **Phone Numbers** on the left section list.
2. Click on the **Verified** Tab and then click on the **Verify a Phone Number** button.
3. Enter a phone number to be verified and click **Call Me**.
4. Enter the verification code received to the phone number and then click on the **Verify** button.

Once verified, the number will appear in the list of verified phone numbers in the SignalWire Dashboard. 
The verified number can now be used to create outbound calls. 
For example, the outbound caller ID on a SIP endpoint in the SignalWire network can be set as one of the verified numbers. 
Here are steps to set the verified number as the default caller ID for all SIP endpoints:

1. On the SignalWire Dashboard, click on **SIP** on the left section list.
2. Click on the **SIP Settings** Tab.
3. Select the verified caller ID number in the dropdown for the section **DEFAULT SEND AS** which selects the caller ID for PSTN calls.
4. Click on the **Save** button.

Here are steps to set the verified number as the caller ID for a specific SIP endpoint:

1. On the SignalWire Dashboard, click on **SIP** on the left section list.
2. Click on the SIP endpointâ€™s username.
3. Select the verified caller ID number in the dropdown for the section **SEND AS** which selects the caller ID for PSTN calls.
4. The number can also be entered under the **CALLER ID** option, which is for SIP to SIP calls.
