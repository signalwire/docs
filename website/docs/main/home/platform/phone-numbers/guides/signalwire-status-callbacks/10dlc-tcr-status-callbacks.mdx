# 10DLC Status Callbacks

10DLC status callbacks allow you to receive real-time notifications when the state of your 10DLC registration changes. This feature enables you to monitor the lifecycle of your messaging brands, campaigns, number assignment orders, and number assignments.

## 10DLC Status Callback Parameters

The following parameters will be posted via an HTTP POST request to your webhook - you can use one or all of them depending on what type of information you are looking for.

## Event Types and State Changes

### Brand Events

Brands can transition through the following states:

| State Transition         | Event Type           | Description                                                          |
| :----------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pending` → `completed`  | `brand_activated`    | The brand has been successfully verified and activated.              |
| `pending` → `unverified` | `brand_unverified`   | The brand verification failed or additional information is required. |
| `unverified` → `completed` | `brand_activated`  | The brand was previously unverified but is now active.               |

### Campaign Events

Campaigns can transition through the following states:

| State Transition     | Event Type             | Description                                               |
| :------------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pending` → `active` | `campaign_activated`   | The campaign has been approved and is now active.         |
| `active` → `inactive`| `campaign_deactivated` | The campaign has been deactivated and can no longer send. |

### Number Assignment Order Events

Number assignment orders have only one possible state change:

| State Transition        | Event Type                          | Description                                                         |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pending` → `processed` | `number_assignment_order_processed` | The number assignment order has been processed and numbers assigned.|


### Number Assignment Events

Number assignments can transition through the following states:

| State Transition       | Event Type                    | Description                                                               |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pending` → `failed`   | `number_assignment_failed`    | The number assignment failed and the number was not assigned to campaign. |
| `failed` → `pending`   | `number_assignment_pending`   | A failed number assignment is being retried.                              |
| `pending` → `completed`| `number_assignment_activated` | The number has been successfully assigned to the campaign.                |

## 10DLC Status Callbacks Application Example

Below is an example of a simple 10DLC status tracker that will log every state change event to the console and store them in separate tables based on the event category. This example monitors brands, campaigns, and number assignments, providing real-time visibility into your 10DLC registration pipeline.

The application will categorize events by type and log them to appropriate tables. For number assignment events, if any failures are detected, they will be logged to a separate failed assignments table for investigation. This allows you to quickly identify and address any issues with number provisioning.

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import logging
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
app = Flask(__name__)

brandEvents = []
campaignEvents = []
numberAssignmentOrderEvents = []
numberAssignmentEvents = []
failedAssignments = []

@app.route("/10dlc-status", methods=['POST'])

    event_category = request.values.get('event_category', None)
    event_type = request.values.get('event_type', None)
    state = request.values.get('state', None)
    brand_id = request.values.get('brand_id', None)
    campaign_id = request.values.get('campaign_id', None)
    number_assignment_order_id = request.values.get('number_assignment_order_id', None)
    number_assignment_id = request.values.get('number_assignment_id', None)
    phone_number_id = request.values.get('phone_number_id', None)
    phone_number = request.values.get('phone_number', None)

        print(df.to_string())

        if state == 'failed':

            print("\nFailed Number Assignments")
            print(failed_df.to_string())

            if len(failedAssignments) >= 10:
                failed_df.to_csv('failed_10dlc_assignments.csv', index=False, encoding='utf-8')
                logging.warning('10 or more number assignment failures detected. CSV report generated.')
                failedAssignments.clear()

    return ('', 200)
