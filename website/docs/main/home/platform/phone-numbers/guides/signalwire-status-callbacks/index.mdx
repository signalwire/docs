# Status Callbacks

Status callbacks allow you to set up a form of event tracking that sends data to the webhook you specify on every status change. The type of data depends on the product: SMS status callbacks will show message status changes whereas recording status callbacks will update when a recording is completed.

In the sections below is comprehensive data on each type of status callback and examples of how to use them. You could easily build a system to monitor your throughput or delivery rate with SMS, push calls logs to your CRM, or simply send recordings via SMS when they are created. There are numerous possibilities for what to do with this data.

## Testing Status Callbacks

If you are building a status callback application and would like a full printout of all of the possible parameters you can use in your application, a helpful tool is [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/). You can copy the unique URL to use as your status callback URL, and you will see all the headers, form data, and query strings if there are any. This is a good way to see examples of the data returned as well as get exact parameter names.

We recommend using `ngrok` as a tunnel for local testing if you don't want to host this script on your own server. You can read more about ngrok [here](/platform/basics/guides/technical-troubleshooting/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok).

To run these exact examples, you will need the Flask framework and [Python SignalWire SDK](/compatibility-api/sdks) downloaded. However, you could recreate them or write your own example using any of the [SignalWire SDKs](/compatibility-api/sdks) and a web framework.

One of the most important parts of voice and SMS status callbacks is the error code for when things go amiss. You can read more about the possible error codes and what they mean [here](/rest/compatibility-api/overview/error-codes).
