SignalWire supports industry-standard WebRTC SIP over WebSockets! This means that you can use off-the-shelf JavaScript libraries with SIP to connect to SignalWire services.

Services enabled in a WebRTC compliant browser include:

- Audio calling to/from Web and PSTN
- product:video calling between Web and SIP endpoints
- Programmatically creating SIP endpoints and directing calls to your WebRTC endpoints

To get started, navigate to your SignalWire Space and [create a new SIP endpoint](/voice/sip/get-started). To use secure protocols, make sure the Encryption is **required**.

Now, you can test the newly created endpoint on a popular JS SIP (JSSIP) library:

![The TryIt JS SIP interface](@image/external/jssip/intro.webP)

{/* <figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./4e31aa1-rtaImage.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the TryIt JS SIP interface. In the 'Your Name' input field, the user has entered 'jssip1'. There is a gear icon and a button labeled 'Reset'." />
</figure> */}

If you click the **gear** icon, you can configure the settings needed to connect to SignalWire. The **SIP URI** is your SignalWire SIP username and domain. The password set on your SIP endpoint can be used in the **SIP password** section to authenticate. The **WebSocket URI** is your domain with an appended **wss://**. To match the encryption on SignalWire, set the transport to TLS. The Registrar Server should be set to your domain.

![The JsSIP UA settings pane](@image/external/jssip/setup.webP)

{/* <figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./8b50f21-rtaImage_1.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the JsSIP UA settings pane, with fields for SIP URI, SIP Password, WebSocket URI, Via Transport, and Registrar Server." />
</figure> */}

Once you've saved the entered information, you will see the endpoint register and turn from yellow to green. 

Then, set up another SIP endpoint with the same process as above.

Now that both of the endpoints are registered, you can place the first call. If you're using SIP endpoints in the same project, you can use short-hand names (for example, jssip1 and jssip2) to place the call:

{/* <figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./ef452c9-rtaImage_4.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the TryIt JsSIP interface showing a green dot next to the jssip2 endpoint. In the field labeled 'SIP URI or username', the endpoint named jssip1 has been entered. A blue button is labeled 'Call'." />
</figure> */}

If everything was set up correctly, you should see a video call from one of the addresses to the other.

In addition, you can attribute a phone number to your created sip endpoint and receive calls from the PSTN! You can also place the outbound calls to the PSTN from the WebRTC client.
