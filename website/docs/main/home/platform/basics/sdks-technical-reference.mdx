## FAQs

## 1. What is RELAY?

RELAY is the next generation of interactive communication APIs available at SignalWire. It is a new, real-time web service protocol that provides for persistent, asynchronous connections to the SignalWire network.

Most providers use [REST APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) that rely on one-way communication. This adds latency and limits interactivity of real-time events. SignalWire's RELAY APIs use WebSocket technology, which allow for simultaneous, bi-directional data transmission. Using RELAY, you can deploy reliable, low latency, real-time communications.

RELAY allows for interactive and advanced command and control. Complete control will enable easy transfers and injections across all endpoints, making it easier and quicker to build applications. RELAY integrates easily with your products and infrastructure, enabling simple but powerful applications using Artificial Intelligence tools, data exchange, serverless technologies and more.

Finally, RELAY enables communications tools to perform in the most popular and widely used environments, like web browsers, mobile devices, in the cloud, or within your own infrastructure.

## 2. What are Alpha and Beta Releases of the SDKs?


As part of our development and release process, we often release software in stages. These stages are referred to as alpha and beta releases. It's important to understand what these terms mean and how they affect you as a user.


### Alpha Releases <span className="badge badge--danger">ALPHA</span> {#alpha}

An alpha release is our first phase of testing. Here's what you need to know about alpha releases:
- **Ready to Test but Feature Incomplete**: Alpha versions are stable enough for testing, but they do not include all the features that will be in the final release.
- **Known Bugs**: There will be bugs, some of which we already know about. However, your feedback is crucial for identifying new issues.
- **Prioritized Input**: As an early access customer using alpha releases, your input is highly valued. Your feedback helps shape the final product, and we prioritize your suggestions and bug reports.

### Beta Releases <span className="badge badge--warning">BETA</span> {#beta}

A beta release is the next stage in our release process. Here's what to expect:
- **Ready to Test and Feature Complete**: Beta versions include all intended features and are ready for comprehensive testing.
- **Known and Unknown Bugs**: While beta versions are more stable than alpha versions, they still contain bugs. We rely on your feedback to find and fix these issues.
- **Prioritized Support**: Customers using beta releases will receive prioritized support when reporting bugs. Your feedback helps us ensure the final product is as robust as possible.

#### **Why Participate in Alpha and Beta Testing?**

Participating in alpha and beta testing allows you to:
- **Get Early Access**: Be the first to try out new features and improvements.
- **Shape the Product**: Your feedback directly influences the development and refinement of our software.
- **Improve Stability**: Help us identify and fix bugs before the general release, ensuring a smoother experience for all users.

#### How We Handle Bugs

Regardless of whether you're using an alpha or beta release, we are committed to addressing bugs promptly. Here's our process:
1. **Identification**: We track all reported bugs and prioritize them based on severity and impact.
2. **Remediation**: We allocate resources to fix bugs in a timely manner.
3. **Communication**: We keep you informed about the status of your reported issues and provide updates as they are resolved.



#### **How to Provide Feedback**

If you encounter a bug or have suggestions for improvement, please report them to our support team. You can reach us via email at [support@signalwire.com](mailto:support@signalwire.com)
or by [submitting a ticket](https://signalwire.zohodesk.com/portal/en/newticket).
