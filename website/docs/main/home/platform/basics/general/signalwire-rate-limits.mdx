# Rate limits

<Subtitle>Platform basics</Subtitle><br/><br/>

The below throughput limits apply to Voice and Messaging.
These are account-level limits that count activity from all Projects within your Space.
Contact Support to [increase a Space's default limits][1], and [contact Support][3] to increase Voice and Messaging throughput.

:::tip separate limits
Rate limits and backlogs for Messaging and Voice are separate.
For example, exceeding the Voice rate limit does ***not*** cause outbound messages to [queue](#queue-and-backlog-system).
:::

## Voice

[View pricing](https://signalwire.com/pricing/voice)
and [contact Support][3] to increase calling throughput.

| Value                                | Default limit             |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Calls                                | `1` call per second (CPS) |
| [Backlog](#queue-and-backlog-system) | `10,000` queued calls     |

## Messaging

[View pricing][2] and [contact Support][3] to increase messaging throughput for toll-free or short code numbers.

| Number type                          | Default limit                                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Toll-free                            | `3` messages per second (MPS)                                                                                                                            |
| US long code (10DLC)                 | `4` MPS <br/><span className="optional-arg">Actual throughput may be lower or higher depending on carrier and [TCR](/messaging/get-started/campaign-registry) limits</span> |
| Canadian long code                   | `1` MPS                                                                                                                                                  |
| Short code                           | `10` MPS                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Backlog](#queue-and-backlog-system) | `10,000` queued messages                                                                                                                                 |

:::warning segments count as messages
Larger messages are automatically split into smaller "segments" which are sent as individual messages.
Each of these segments counts towards the messages per second (MPS) limit.
Consult the guide to [Messaging Character Limits](/messaging/guides/general/messaging-character-limits) for more information.

## API

The below limits apply to all API requests across the SignalWire platform.
Every HTTP request includes the user's current limit and remaining requests in its X-Header.

| HTTP verb                                                                                                                                    | Limit                             |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| <span class="badge badge--success">GET</span> <span class="badge badge--danger">DELETE</span>                                                | Effectively unlimited             |
| <span class="badge badge--primary">POST</span> <span class="badge badge--warning">PUT</span> <span class="badge badge--warning">PATCH</span> | `13800` requests per `10` seconds |

## Queue and backlog system

When an application sends calls or messages to SignalWire at a rate exceeding the applicable rate limit, 
SignalWire **queues** these messages or calls in the order received.
The **backlog** is the limit to the number of queued (pending) calls or messages.
The Voice backlog and Messaging backlog are both `10,000` by default.

When the backlog for calls is full, SignalWire will stop adding additional calls to the Voice queue.
Similarly, when the backlog for messages is full, SignalWire will stop adding to the Messaging queue.
The platform will process queued calls or messages at the maximum applicable rate, and add new calls or messages to the queue as long as the backlog has not been reached.

:::info separate backlogs
The Voice and Messaging backlogs are entirely separate.

If you would like to raise your Voice or Messaging backlog, [request an increase to your Space limits][1].
