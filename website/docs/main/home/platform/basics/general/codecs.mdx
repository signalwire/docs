# Supported codecs

SignalWire supports a variety of industry-standard codecs to ensure high-quality communication across different use cases.

Choosing the right codec depends on your specific requirements,
including bandwidth availability, quality expectations, and compatibility needs.
Below you'll find the codecs supported by SignalWire, organized by their primary use case.

## Audio codecs

SignalWire supports the following audio codecs for voice communication:

<APIField name="PCMU (G.711 μ-law)">
  A standard audio codec using μ-law companding. Standard for North American voice/audio communication.
</APIField>

<APIField name="PCMA (G.711 A-law)">
  Similar to PCMU but uses A-law companding. Standard for European and International voice/audio communication.
</APIField>

<APIField name="G722 (Wideband audio)">
  Wideband audio codec that operates at 7 kHz audio bandwidth. Ideal for conference calling.
</APIField>

<APIField name="G729">
  Narrowband codec best for bandwidth-constrained environments. Ideal in VoIP applications where bandwidth conservation is critical.
</APIField>

<APIField name="OPUS">
  Versatile, modern codec that adapts to varying network conditions and bandwidth availability. Recommended codec for WebRTC applications.
</APIField>

## Video codecs

SignalWire supports the following video codecs for video communication:

<APIField name="VP8">
  Open-source video codec widely supported in WebRTC applications, preferred choice for video conferencing.
</APIField>

<APIField name="H264 (H.264)">
  Also known as AVC (Advanced Video Coding). Ideal for applications requiring high-quality video with efficient bandwidth usage.
</APIField>

## Streaming codecs

SignalWire supports the following codecs for real-time streaming via Stream/WebSocket connections:

<APIField name="L16@24000h (Linear PCM at 24000 Hz)">
  Uncompressed linear PCM audio at 24 kHz sampling rate. Ideal for scenarios where audio quality is paramount and bandwidth is not a constraint.
</APIField>

<APIField name="L16@16000h (Linear PCM at 16000 Hz)">
  Uncompressed linear PCM audio at 16 kHz sampling rate. Ideal for speech processing and real-time audio analysis applications.
</APIField>
