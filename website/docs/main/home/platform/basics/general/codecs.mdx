# Supported codecs

<Subtitle>Platform basics</Subtitle>

Codecs (coder-decoders) are essential components in telecommunications that compress and decompress audio and video data for transmission.
SignalWire supports a variety of industry-standard codecs to ensure high-quality communication across different use cases,
from traditional voice calls to modern video conferencing and real-time streaming applications.

Choosing the right codec depends on your specific requirements,
including bandwidth availability, quality expectations, and compatibility needs.
Below you'll find the codecs supported by SignalWire, organized by their primary use case.

SignalWire supports the following audio codecs for voice communication:

**PCMU (G.711 μ-law)**
A standard audio codec using μ-law companding, commonly used in North American and Japanese telecommunications.
It provides toll-quality voice at 64 kbps with minimal latency.

**PCMA (G.711 A-law)**
Similar to PCMU but uses A-law companding, predominantly used in European and international telecommunications.
Also operates at 64 kbps with excellent voice quality.

**G722 (Wideband audio)**
A wideband audio codec that operates at 7 kHz audio bandwidth,
providing superior voice quality compared to narrowband codecs.
It offers better clarity for speech and is ideal for conference calls.

**G729**
A narrowband codec that provides good quality voice at only 8 kbps,
making it highly efficient for bandwidth-constrained environments.
Commonly used in VoIP applications where bandwidth conservation is critical.

**OPUS**
A versatile, modern codec that adapts to varying network conditions and bandwidth availability.
OPUS provides excellent audio quality across a wide range of bitrates and is suitable for both voice and music.
It is the recommended codec for WebRTC applications.

SignalWire supports the following video codecs for video communication:

**VP8**
An open-source video codec developed by Google, providing good quality video compression.
VP8 is royalty-free and widely supported in WebRTC applications,
making it an excellent choice for video conferencing.

**H264 (H.264)**
Also known as AVC (Advanced Video Coding), H.264 is one of the most widely used video compression standards.
It provides excellent video quality at various bitrates and resolutions,
offering broad compatibility across devices and platforms.
H.264 is ideal for applications requiring high-quality video with efficient bandwidth usage.

  title="Streaming codecs"
  description="For Stream/WebSocket applications"
>

SignalWire supports the following codecs for real-time streaming via Stream/WebSocket connections:

**L16@24000h (Linear PCM at 24000 Hz)**
Uncompressed linear PCM audio at 24 kHz sampling rate,
providing high-fidelity audio for applications requiring minimal processing latency.
Best suited for scenarios where audio quality is paramount and bandwidth is not a constraint.

**L16@16000h (Linear PCM at 16000 Hz)**
Uncompressed linear PCM audio at 16 kHz sampling rate,
offering a balance between audio quality and bandwidth usage.
Suitable for speech processing and real-time audio analysis applications.

**audio/x-mulaw (Default PCMU/mulaw at 8000 Hz)**
The default streaming codec using PCMU (μ-law) compression at 8 kHz sampling rate.
This is the standard format for traditional telephony and provides efficient,
low-latency audio streaming for voice applications.
