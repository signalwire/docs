[FusionPBX](https://www.fusionpbx.com/) is a FreeSWITCH-based multi-tenant PBX that provides a robust set of features for business phone systems. Using SignalWire services with FusionPBX allows you to leverage our high call quality and low rates.

Creating a SIP Endpoint
-----------------------

If you don't have a SIP endpoint set up already, the first step is to [create a SIP Endpoint](/voice/sip/get-started) and connect it to a phone number.

FusionPBX GUI Set Up
--------------------

From your FusionPBX installation's web GUI go to **Accounts** > **Gateways**. 

<Frame caption="The Gateways item under Accounts.">

![The Gateways item under Accounts.](@image/external/fusionpbx/01_gateways.webp)

</Frame>

This is where you will use the credentials you created in the first step. Once you are in the **Gateways** section, click the **ADD** button in the top right corner. 

<Frame caption="Selecting the Add button in the Gateways section.">

![Selecting the Add button in the Gateways section.](@image/external/fusionpbx/02_add_gateways.webp)

</Frame>

Enter the following information in the **Gateway** form:

Gateway: This is a label. In this example we will define this as signalwire  
Username: Your username as created in the SIP endpoint on SignalWire  
Password: The password you set above  
Proxy: YOURSPACE-SIPDOMAIN.sip.signalwire.com (Replace with your proxy address)  
Register: True


:::info Proxy Address

The Proxy address and other SIP credentials can be found in the SignalWire Dashboard by going to the **SIP** > **SIP Settings** tab as shown below.

:::

<Frame caption="Selecting the SIP Settings pane of the SIP tab.">

</Frame>

Click the **Advanced** button to expand additional settings

<ol>
<li>Register Transport: TLS (This can also be TCP but is better to be secure with TLS)</li>
<li>Ping: 90</li>
<li>Profile: internal</li>
<li>Enabled: True Click save at the top right corner.</li>
</ol>
Your form should look similar to the following.


:::info TLS

In order to use TLS on your FusionPBX installation, you **must** have SSL certificates like Let's Encrypt or others configured. You can find this detailed further in the FusionPBX member documentation.

You should now have a gateway registered(REGED) as shown in the image below! If you don't see it yet, try clicking **Start**.

<Frame caption="A screenshot of a table with gateways. The example gateway reads 'REGED' in the State column.">

Making Outbound Calls over SignalWire
-------------------------------------

After the gateway is configured in your FusionPBX installation and registered, we can now configure an outbound route! Go to **Dialplan** > **Outbound Routes** and click the **ADD** button at the top right.

<Frame caption="A screenshot of the Dialplan menu, with Outbound Routes selected.">

</Frame>

<Frame caption="Selecting the Add button.">

![Selecting the Add button.](@image/external/fusionpbx/07_outbound_routes_add.webp)

</Frame>

Fill in the form with a few simple settings:

<ol>
<li>Gateway: Select signalwire from the drop down list</li>
<li>Dialplan Expression: Choose North America (This can be typed in manually or you can pick other areas also)</li>
</ol>

Check your form is similar to the following, and click **Save**.

Recieving Inbound Calls over SignalWire
---------------------------------------

Go to **Accounts** > **Extensions**. Here you can create an extension. This is needed to point your registered peer to so you can receive calls.

<Frame caption="Selecting the Extensions item in the Accounts menu.">

![Selecting the Extensions item in the Accounts menu.](@image/external/fusionpbx/09_extensions.webp)

</Frame>

Create an extension by clicking the **Add** button at the top right. In this example, we will create extension **900** and click **Save** at the top right.

Go to **Dialplan** > **Destinations** from your FusionPBX installation. We will now create an inbound route to connect the SignalWire peer and the extension you just created.

<Frame caption="Selecting the Destinations item in the Dialplan menu.">

![Selecting the Destinations item in the Dialplan menu.](@image/external/fusionpbx/10_destinations.webp)

</Frame>

Create a destination by clicking the **+ADD** button at the top right.

<Frame caption="Selecting the Add button.">

![Selecting the Add button.](@image/external/fusionpbx/11_destinations_add.webp)

</Frame>

Fill in the form with the necessary information

<ol>
<li>Destination: Your SignalWire phone number, with the +1 (eg. +15556677888)</li>
<li>Caller ID Name: This is optional (also see the documentation for Caller ID settings on SignalWire)</li>
<li>Caller ID Number: This is optional</li>
<li>Actions: 900 (This is where the call will go to). The actions can be an extension, IVR, Time condition, etc.</li>
</ol>

Click the **Save** button at the top right, after checking your form looks similar to the following.

<Frame caption="Form settings.">

This next step is **VERY** important. This must be set in order to receive calls to your FusionPBX installation. In the menu, look for **Advanced** > **Default Settings** and click the **Add** button on the top right.

<Frame caption="Selecting the Add button under Default Settings.">

![Selecting the Add button under Default Settings.](@image/external/fusionpbx/13_sip_default_setting.webp)

</Frame>

In the form, enter the following information:

1. Category: dialplan
2. Subcategory: destination
3. Type: text
4. Value: `${sip_to_user}`
5. Enabled: True
6. Description: optional

Check the form looks similar to the following, then click **Save**. After saving, click the top right **Reload** button.

Access Control
--------------

The IPs are needed to make/receive calls, but they can change frequently.  You can find the IPs by querying sip.signalwire.com. CIDR is used so IPs must be added with a  x.x.x.x/32.

**Windows**  
`nslookup sip.signalwire.com`

**Mac/linux**  
`dig sip.signalwire.com`

You can add these in **Advanced** --> **Access Controls** --> **Domains**. 

<Frame caption="A screenshot of the Access Control page, with a list of nodes.">

fail2ban
--------

If you are using [fail2ban](https://docs.fusionpbx.com/en/latest/firewall/fail2ban.html) to protect FreeSWITCH, you can add SignalWire IPs directly to iptables via the linux command line!
