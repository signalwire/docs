SignalWire allows you to easily integrate with your existing providers via SIP as a Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC).  
[thinQ](https://www.thinq.com/) is a voice API platform that can be integrated with SignalWire as BYOC.  Follow the steps below to have inbound calls from thinQ routed to SignalWire as well as outbound calls from SignalWire routed to thinQ.

Create a SIP Domain Application
-------------------------------

The [SIP Domain Applications](/voice/getting-started/sip/sip-domain-applications) guide
describes SIP Domain Applications and the process of creating one in your space.

To follow along to this guide, name the Domain App **thinQBYOC** and input **BYOC** for the APP URL and save the application.
Copy the URL generated for the Domain App as you’ll need it during your inbound routing profile setup inside thinQ.

Create an Inbound Routing Profile at thinQ
------------------------------------------

Go to **thinQ.io > Inbound > Routing Profiles > Inbound Profiles**

Click on a new profile, and use **SignalWire-YourCompanyName** or just **SignalWire** as the name.

Select **DNS A** for Type and enter the full SignalWire Domain App URL for Address.

:::info Multiple SIP Domains for different applications

You may want to create multiple SIP Domains on SignalWire for different applications, which would allow you to create additional routing profiles. Be sure your naming system is descriptive so you recognize what it matches within SignalWire.

Configuring SignalWire for thinQ Outbound Call Routing
------------------------------------------------------

Go to **thinq.io > Outbound > Trunks > Add New**.

![The Trunks pane of the Outbound tab of the thinQ interface, with a red arrow pointing to the button labeled 'Add New'](@image/external/thinq/add_new_trunk.webp)

Give the trunk a name and then choose the thinQ Profile that you want to associate the trunk with from the **Select Trunk Type** drop-down and select **Connect**.

For **Select your trunk carrier**, click **SignalWire** and then click **Save**.

![The Create Outbound Trunk page, with a red arrow pointing to the SignalWire logo](@image/external/thinq/signalwire_trunk.webp)

Navigate to **thinq.io > Outbound > Trunks** and click on the Token icon to the right of your newly created SignalWire Trunk.  This token and your thinQ Account ID will be needed to configure the SIP URI in SignalWire. This is required for routing outbound calls from SignalWire through thinQ.

Making Outbound Calls via the cXML API
-----------------------------------------------

Take a look a a full example using Ruby:

```ruby
require ‘signalwire/sdk’
client = Signalwire::REST::Client.new ‘your-project’, ‘your-token’, signalwire_space_url: “example.signalwire.com”

call = client.calls.create(
url: ‘http://YOURSPACE.signalwire.com/YOUR-LAML-BIN-ID’,
to: ‘sip:12155551212@wap.thinq.com?X-account-id=0123&X-account-token=4567890;transport=udp?header1=foo&header2=bar’,
from: ‘+15559988777’,
sip_auth_username: ‘user’,
sip_auth_password: ‘pass’
)
```

```bash
curl https://<YOURSPACE>.signalwire.com/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/<YOURACCOUNTSID>/Calls.json \
  -X POST \
  --data-urlencode "Url=http://your-application.com/docs/voice.xml" \
  --data-urlencode "sip:12155551212@wap.thinq.com?X-account-id=0123&X-account-token=4567890;transport=udp?header1=foo&header2=bar" \
  --data-urlencode "From=+15550011222" \
  --data-urlencode "SipAuthUsername=user" \
  --data-urlencode "SipAuthPassword=pass" \
  -u "YourProjectID:YourAuthToken"
```
