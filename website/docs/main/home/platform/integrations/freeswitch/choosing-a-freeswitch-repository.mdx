SignalWire has a few different repositories for accessing the FreeSWITCH code base. Repositories are divided into publicly accessible repo's for the community at large, and privately accessible repo's for indentured customers.

The primary differences between Public and Advantage (FSA) repos are intervals at which each repos receives updates, improvements, and fixes. FreeSWITCH Advantage will receive nearly all code commits as soon as they are tested as operational. Once the code committed to the FSE repo has been vetted a few seasons for stability, it will then matriculate to the Public for community consumption.

Furthermore, each repo can be broken down to release and unstable branches. A release branch is ideal for production environments. An unstable branch would be ideal for your lab/testing/QA environment. Release branches are updated nearly every other season or so, depending on the state of release readiness. The Unstable branches are updated nightly, weekly, at most every couple of weeks or so.

Lastly, you have options for your distribution of choice. We support Debian Stretch and Buster.  
Here is an outline of useful commands for updating your Aptitude sources list to enable access to each repo.


:::info Important Note!

You will need a subscription and username and password to access the FSA repository.
