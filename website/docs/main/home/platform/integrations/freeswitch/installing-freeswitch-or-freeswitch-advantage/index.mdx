## FreeSWITCH Terminology

Before we begin, here is some general FreeSWITCH terminology that may be important for understanding this article!

| Term                 | Meaning                                                                                                                               |
|:---------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FreeSWITCH           | The publicly released version of FreeSWITCH for the community at large.                                                               |
| FreeSWITCH Advantage | The privately release version of FreeSWITCH for subscribed customers.                                                                 |
| FS                   | A generic term applicable to either FreeSWITCH or FreeSWITCH Advantage                                                                |
| Production Server    | A FreeSWITCH or FreeSWITCH Advantage installation of packages from our stable repo.                                                   |
| Staging Server       | A FreeSWITCH or FreeSWITCH Advantage installation of packages from our unstable repo.                                                 |
| Lab Server           | A FreeSWITCH or FreeSWITCH Advantage installation by compilation of source code, build dependencies installed from the unstable repo. |

## Getting an Access Token

A SignalWire account is now required to download the pre-build FreeSWITCH binaries. First [create a SignalWire Space](/platform/dashboard/getting-started/signing-up-for-a-space), then go to the `Personal Access Tokens`
section located on the left side of the Dashboard. From there, create a Personal Access Token. [Click here to learn more](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/Debian).

In case you missed the previous emails on the matter, here is the recap of this change:

- This specifically (and only) affects the built copy of the FreeSWITCH software - the binaries that turn Linux into FreeSWITCH instantly.
- It does not impact actively running instances or change the process for accessing the open-source code, which will continue to be freely available on GitHub.
- It may affect how you obtain FreeSWITCH dependencies or FreeSWITCH packages from our package repositories such as our Debian repository.
- The changes do not affect our FreeSWITCH Advantage method of authenticating.
