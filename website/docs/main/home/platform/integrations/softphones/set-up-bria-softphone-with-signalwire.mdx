Bria Mobile is a popular softphone app that works very well with SignalWire! Here are the steps to get started with connecting to Bria Mobile. 

Create a SIP Endpoint and Register It to a SignalWire Phone Number
------------------------------------------------------------------

The first step is to [create a SIP Endpoint](/voice/sip/get-started) and connect it to a phone number. When creating this endpoint, keep the default **Encryption** and default **Codecs/Ciphers**. 

Set up the SIP Endpoint with Bria Mobile
----------------------------------------

Now that you have a SIP endpoint and phone number registered to it, you can connect to Bria!  
Launch the Bria mobile app, click **Settings** to enter the **Accounts** page, click **+** on the top-right corner, and click **SIP** to turn to the SIP account registration page.


:::info Account Name vs Display Name

You can choose **any** Account Name and Display Name as these are only for the user's benefit to help distinguish between multiple accounts.

:::

Enter the username, password, and domain chosen within your SIP Endpoint Settings in SignalWire. Make sure to copy these fields **exactly** - it will **not** be able to register if they do not match. This includes additional whitespace at the end.

Next, changes will need to be made to the **Transport Settings**. To use Bria with SignalWire SIP Endpoint, go into **Account Advanced **-> **TLS Cert Management** and disable **Verify TLS Cert**. If this feature is not disabled, the registration will **not** complete successfully.

Next, go back to the **SIP Account Page** and click **Enabled** at the top. The registration should now be completed, you are now ready to use Bria with SignalWire!
