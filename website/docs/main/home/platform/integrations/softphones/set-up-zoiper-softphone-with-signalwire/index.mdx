Zoiper is a popular desktop softphone app used to make/receive calls! Follow this guide to set up Zoiper with SignalWire. 

## Create a SIP Endpoint and Register It to a SignalWire Phone Number

The first step is to [create a SIP Endpoint](/voice/sip/get-started) and connect it to a phone number. When creating this endpoint, keep the default **Encryption** and default **Codecs/Ciphers**.

In order to set up Zoiper with SignalWire, regardless of the platform, you will need the following:
- Your SIP Endpoint username;
- Your SIP Endpoint domain;
- Your SIP Endpoint password.

Your full SIP domain is always your username and domain with an @ in-between: **_YOUR_USERNAME_**_@_**_YOUR_DOMAIN_**, so it may look something like: `ZoiperEndpoint@example.sip.signalwire.com`

## Set up Zoiper Applications
You are now ready to connect with Zoiper! Let's take a look at how to do this on both Desktop and Mobile.

### On Desktop
Open the Zoiper application and click on the **Settings** gear icon.  Click on **Accounts** and then click **Add**.

Enter your full SIP domain such as `ZoiperEndpoint@example.sip.signalwire.com`. If you don't remember the SIP domain created in the previous step, go back to your SIP Endpoint and copy the full address under **Username**. 

You can skip the ‘Optional: Authentication and Outbound Proxy’ step, this is not needed. When asked for a **Transport Method**, choose either [TLS](https://cybernews.com/resources/web-hosting-glossary/#ssl-tls) or TCP. You should now see a green checkmark next to the SIP endpoint in your Zoiper window, indicating you're ready to make calls!

If you are having trouble getting your endpoint to authenticate, go to Advanced Settings and check to make sure your settings match the below reference table!

Item | Value
---|---
Transport | TCP
Registration expiry mode | Custom
Registration expiry | 60
Subscription expiry mode | Default (UDP - 60s; TCP - 600s)
Subscription expiry | 0
Keep alive time-out | Custom
Keep alive custom interval | 30
Use rport | Yes 
Use rport media | Yes
Use STUN | Use global STUN

### On Android
Open the Zoiper application and you should see something similar to this screen. Enter your full SIP domain such as `ZoiperEndpoint@example.sip.signalwire.com`. If you don't remember the SIP domain created in the previous step, go back to your SIP Endpoint and copy the full address under **Username**. Under Password, enter your SIP endpoint password, and then tap "Create an account":

You'll then see a screen which should have the hostname (your SIP domain) already populated. Just tap "Next":

Next you'll be taken to authentication screen. you can skip this page by clicking the Skip button.

Lastly, Zoiper will try to find compatible protocols to use. Give it a few seconds, and once SIP TLS turns green you can tap on "Finish":

:::info Inconsistencies receiving incoming calls 

Due to recent changes on the iOS and Android operating systems, incoming calls on Zoiper may not work reliably in background. 

To address this, we suggest taking advantage of [Zoiper's `Push Proxy` feature](https://www.zoiper.com/en/support/home/article/205/Zoiper_Push_Proxy).

Tap on the `+` icon in the top-right corner of the screen to add a new account.

When asked if you already have an account, select `Yes`.

Select the `Manual configuration` option to configure it with SignalWire's SIP settings.

When choosing an account type, since you're going to be using a SIP endpoint, select `SIP account`:

You're finally in the SIP account setup page, and here you'll need to fill in the following fields:
- `Account name` -> The label you'd like to give the account (so you know which one is which);
- `Domain` -> Your SIP endpoint domain, such as `example.sip.signalwire.com`;
- `User name` -> Your SIP Endpoint username;
- `Password` -> Your SIP Endpoint password.

Once filled, tap on `Register` at the top of the screen and wait a few seconds. When you see `Registration Status: OK`, you can start going back to the main screen by tapping on `Accounts` in the top-left corner of the screen, and then on `Settings`.

That's all there is to it, and you can now start using Zoiper on iOS with SignalWire!
