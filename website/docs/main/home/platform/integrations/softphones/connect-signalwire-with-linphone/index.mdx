Using SignalWire and Linphone Softphone for SIP
-----------------------------------------------

[Linphone](https://www.linphone.org/products) is an open-source voice/video over IP (VoIP) phone that makes it possible to communicate freely with people over the internet via voice. Linphone is unique in that it is supported on iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, and GNU/Linux making it a fantastic choice for those in need of a softphone. Keep reading to get SignalWire and Linphone set up in minutes! 

Configuring SignalWire and Linphone
-----------------------------------

The first step is to [create a SIP Endpoint](/voice/sip/get-started) and point a SignalWire purchased number to that endpoint. When creating this endpoint, keep the default **Encryption** and default **Codecs/Ciphers**.

We will now use the details of the sip endpoint we created to connect to Linphone. If you haven't already downloaded Linphone, check out some [getting started guides](https://wiki.linphone.org/xwiki/wiki/public/) on their public Linphone wiki!

Under the hamburger menu in the upper right click **Preferences** then **Add Account**.

Next, we will need to go through the following settings pages in order to specify the correct information. Make sure to disable **Enable AVPF** and **Enable ICE** or it will not work correctly. 


:::info SIP Address and SIP Server Address are created using the SIP domain generated after creating a SIP endpoint in the first step

- **SIP address**: sip:linphone@user-0545bce90b65.sip.signalwire.com
- **SIP Server address**: \<sip:user-0545bce90b65.sip.signalwire.com;transport=tls>

If you get the error **Unable to Authenticate. Please verify your password.**, enter your SIP endpoint password and click **Login**.
