What is Google Cloud Functions?
-------------------------------

GCF is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. It allows you to run a webhook for your SignalWire application without having to host a web server, and it is a good alternative in case you need some simple logic that cannot be achieved just by using XML.

The example application sets up a webhook to handle a phone call. In this case we will check the day of the week, and return a different greeting depending on the day. This is simple logic, yet hard to accomplish using static cXML applications, and you might not want to set up a full web server just to host this snippet.

Setting up Google Cloud Functions
---------------------------------

Start with [the Google Cloud Functions HTTP tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/tutorials/http).

You will have to set up a few things:

- The `gcloud` command-line tool
- A Google Cloud account with billing enabled
- Your first project
- `gcloud login`

Configuring the Code
--------------------

The function we developed as a sample is pretty straightforward, and as you can see is plain Node Javascript, without anything specific to being deployed on Google Cloud Functions. Make sure to have NodeJS version `10` installed.

```js
const { RestClient } = require('@signalwire/compatibility-api')

exports.helloLaml = (req, res) => {
  const response = new RestClient.LaML.VoiceResponse();
  try {
    var d = new Date();
    if (d.getDay() == 0) {
      response.say('Happy Sunday! Our store is closed today');
    } else {
      response.say('Hello! Our store is open from 9 to 6 today.');
    }
  } catch(err) {
    console.log(err.message);
  } finally {
    res.status(200)
      .set('Content-Type', 'text/xml')
      .send(response.toString());
  }
};
```

Deploying the Code to Google Cloud Functions
--------------------------------------------

After setting up the necessary prerequisites above, clone this repository and deploy your function using the command below:

`cloud functions deploy hello-laml --trigger-http --runtime nodejs10 --entry-point=helloLaml --allow-unauthenticated`

In the above, we deploy a function named `hello-laml`, specifying it should use the `helloLaml` method from the `index.js` file as entrypoint, and we allow requests to come in unauthenticated.

The GCF CLI output will contain an URL similar to `https://us-central1-yourprojectname.cloudfunctions.net/hello-laml`. That is the URL to use as your webhook in the SignalWire Dashboard.
