# Integrating with Dialogflow Agents

<DeprecationWarning />

Dialogflow agents allow you to use and build engaging, conversational interfaces
powered by Google's Dialogflow AI. You can import Dialogflow agents in your
[SignalWire Space](https://signalwire.com/signin) and connect them to your
numbers.

Follow this guide to learn how to connect a Dialogflow agent.

## Linking Dialogflow

To begin, Navigate to the **Dialogflow** tab in your [SignalWire Dashboard](https://signalwire.com/signin). Once you are there, click on the "Import" or "Add" button.

</Frame>

A popup will prompt you to open the Dialogflow Console. After clicking on _"Go
to Dialogflow Console"_, you will get redirected to Dialogflow's landing page.
Once there, select the **Integrations** tab from the left sidebar. Then, click on _SignalWire_ to begin
the integration process.

</Frame>

Give this new Integration a name and then click **Sign Up**

</Frame>

Once you sign in and consent Dialogflow to access your SignalWire cloud Space, the next step is to associate a phone number to this agent. You can click **Link with New Number** to have a number purchased and configured for this. Or, you can edit your phone settings after this integration to use a number that is already in your Space.

## Creating a Dialogflow Agent

Now that your SignalWire Space and a number have been linked with your Dialogflow account, it is time to create a new Agent. On the left panel, click on **Create new agent**.

<Frame caption="To create a new agent, click on the left menu in Dialogflow.">

</Frame>

Then, name your new agent and click **Create**. Once your agent is created, click on the Settings (Gear) icon in the top right corner of the screen which is next to your agent's name.

Once in the settings of your agent, click on the **Export and Import** tab. If you have an agent that is already stored locally, you can import this as a zip file. For this demo, we will click **Import From Zip**. Our sample zip file can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CemwQwXXmhyo2tpNX_nnFtKy0W4NN6xg/view).

**Note:** after selecting the zip file to upload, you must type in "IMPORT" for the import to process successfully.

</Frame>

Congratulations! Your agent is now up and running within your Dialogflow account, which is linked to your SignalWire Space. You can try this out by typing into the console on the right side of your Dialogflow Dashboard.

<Frame caption="Your agent is up and running.">

Contexts listed are sales and sales-followup. The Intent field is labeled 'Transfer to Sales'.](@image/external/dialogflow/Dialogueflow_connected.webp)
</Frame>

In addition, you can remove imported agents from your SignalWire Space. Removing agents will make them unavailable when creating future Dialogflow calls and will be removed from any Phone Numbers that are configured to use it. You can add these removed agents back anytime.

To handle calls using Dialogflow agents, configure your phone numbers to handle calls using a Dialogflow Agent and choose which agent to run when a call comes in.

<Frame caption="You can associate a phone number to Dialogflow by configuring your phone number within your SignalWire Space.">

</Frame>

You may also re-import DialogFlow agents to upgrade to the new integration method within the SignalWire Space.

## Upgrading your Dialogflow Agent

Within your SignalWire Space, navigate to the Dialogflow section. Then, click on the “Update Required” badge associated with the agent that needs to be re-imported.

  ![The Dialogflow section of the SignalWire Space. There is a yellow 'Update Required badge next to the Agent Name.](@image/external/dialogflow/Upgrading_df_1.webp)
</Frame>

Because the new integration method is initiated from within the Dialogflow interface, a modal is presented describing the next steps and a link to open the Dialogflow console where the agent can be re-imported using the new integration method.
