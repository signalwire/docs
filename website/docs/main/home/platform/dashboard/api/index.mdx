# API credentials

<Subtitle>The SignalWire Dashboard</Subtitle>

The API credentials found on this page are your key to accessing SignalWire's APIs and SDKs.

</Frame>

Most SignalWire API endpoints require authentication using [HTTP Basic Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). HTTP Basic Authentication requires you to send an Authorization header with your Project ID and API Token. This should be supported in almost all HTTP clients.

Each project has its own Project ID and API Authentication Tokens you will need to use when making a request to the API. Some methods will also require you to pass your Space URL.

- **Project ID:** Use this UUID to specify your project to the API.
- **Space URL:** Use this URL to access SignalWire APIs. The Space name is used to access a space-specific endpoint.
- **API Tokens:** Authentication tokens to access the API. You can have multiple
  tokens for each project.

:::info API Tokens vs Client-Side Tokens

API tokens are protected and used server-side to access the API. The tokens we refer to when using Video, Chat, or Fabric products in the browser are not the same tokens we generate and store here. Instead, you use your API token to call an endpoint that generates a client-side token:

- **Video Room Tokens**: Generated via the [Create Room Token](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/video/room-tokens-create) endpoint. See our [Simple Video Demo](/video/getting-started/simple-video-demo).
- **Chat Tokens**: Generated for chat applications. See our [Simple Chat Demo](/chat/getting-started/get-started-with-a-simple-chat-demo).
- **Subscriber Access Tokens (SAT)**: Generated via the [Create Subscriber Token](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/fabric/subscriber-tokens-create) endpoint for Fabric applications.

For more details on authentication methods, see the [REST API Authorization guide](/rest/signalwire-rest/overview/authorization).

## Generate a new API token {#generating-a-new-api-token}

To generate a new API token, click the blue "+ New" button. A "New API Token" form will open.

:::tip
Give your token a descriptive name to help differentiate it in logs and for debugging.
You may choose a limited set of permissions based on the scope of your application.
:::

You can edit the token name and allowed scopes later by clicking the **⋯** button and selecting "Edit."
You may also delete a token from the same dropdown menu or the Edit page.

## API Token Scopes {#api-token-scopes}

API tokens can be configured with specific scopes that limit which APIs the token can access. When creating or editing an API token, you can select which scopes to enable under the "Permissions" section.

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Voice | Access to voice/calling APIs |
| Chat | Access to chat APIs |
| Fax | Access to fax APIs |
| Management | Access to account and project management APIs |
| Messaging | Access to SMS/MMS messaging APIs |
| Numbers | Access to phone number management APIs |
| Pubsub | Access to pub/sub APIs |
| Storage | Access to storage APIs |
| Tasks | Access to task APIs |
| Video | Access to video APIs |
| DataSphere | Access to DataSphere APIs |

:::tip Principle of Least Privilege
For security best practices, only enable the scopes your application actually needs. This limits the potential impact if a token is compromised.
:::

If your API request returns a `401 Unauthorized` error, verify that your API token has the required scope enabled for that endpoint.

## Use an API Token {#using-api-tokens}

:::caution Token Security

It is important that the API tokens are kept confidential. 
Take extreme care to make sure that the tokens aren't pushed to GitHub or made publicly accessible. 
For Node.js backend, you can use [dotenv files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) 
or similar mechanisms paired with a [gitignore file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) 
to safely store confidential constants.

:::

All API requests must be made with proper authentication over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP or without auth will fail.

Find the correct credentials structure for each specific call in the [SDK Reference](/sdks/realtime-sdk), 
[REST API Reference](/rest), 
or in a specific [Guide](/guides/) you may wish to follow.

For a general example, we can look at how to list video rooms with the **REST API**:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="shell" label="cURL">

```shell
curl https://<space-name>.signalwire.com/api/video/rooms \
-u '<project ID>:<API token>'
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="javascript" label="Node.js">

We use the external dependency [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) to make this call, so it must also be imported and installed.

```javascript
// npm install axios
import axios from "axios";

await axios
  .get("https://<space name>.signalwire.com/api/video/rooms", {
    auth: { username: "<project ID>", password: "<API token>" },
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

---

Or with the **Realtime SDK**, you may use these credentials to create a Video Client.

```javascript
import { Video } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const video = new Video.Client({
  project: "<project ID>",
  token: "<API token>",
});
```

Note that you are not required to pass the Space URL when working with the SDK.
