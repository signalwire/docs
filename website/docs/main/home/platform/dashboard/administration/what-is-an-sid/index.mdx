# What is a SID?

A SID is a Segment ID serving as a security identifier.
It is a universally unique alphanumeric string generated for all communication aspects on our platform.
Projects, calls, SMS, recordings, faxes, cXML bins, and nearly all SignalWire components have a unique SID for logging and tracking purposes.

## How to locate your SIDs

SIDs can be found in the logs section of your [SignalWire Dashboard](https://my.signalwire.com/logs/voices).
You will see sections related to Voice, Conferencing, Messaging, and Fax. 
To gather the SID, click on a log in any of these sections and open it.

## Providing SIDs for support

When filing a ticket with SignalWire Support, always include the SID from the log where the incident occured.
For failing messages or calls, this SID allows for the support team to quickly isolate and investigate the issue.
