# Increase Space limits

When a SignalWire Space has reached its [default limits](#default_limits), 
SignalWire Support is able to increase them on a case-by-case basis per our customers' needs.

:::info Trial Mode

These limits apply to SignalWire Spaces **not in Trial mode**. 
New accounts remain in Trial mode until at least $5 USD of credit is added. 
Consult the [Trial Mode](/platform/dashboard/billing#trial-mode) guide for more information.

## Default limits {#default_limits}

You can find the **Default Limits** for each SignalWire Space below.

| Space limit               | Default   |
| :------------------------ | :-------- |
| Number of Projects        | Unlimited |
| Phone numbers per Project | 1000      |
| Verified IDs              | 1000      |
| Call backlog              | 10,000    |
| Message backlog           | 10,000    |

Refer to the [Rate Limits](/platform/basics/general/signalwire-rate-limits)
guide for more information on queueing and backlogs for Calls and Messages.

## Request increased limits

Request an increase to your Space's default limits by filling out the
[SignalWire Space Increase Request Form](https://forms.signalwire.me/Space-Increase-Request.html)
and submitting the required form and necessary documentation to start the account verification process. 

SignalWireâ€™s Space Compliance team reviews submissions to approve or deny the request. 
They will then notify the submitting user of the results or request additional information to approve.

### Phone number limits

If you need more than 1000 phone numbers in a single project, the request must be approved by our team of Account Executives.
Please be prepared to share detailed information about your use case.

:::caution Auto top-up required

If approved, you **MUST** set up auto top up on your project to the total cost of the numbers monthly **before the limit will be raised**.
This requirement prevents the suspension of services due to insufficient balance.
Pricing for phone numbers can be found on the [SignalWire pricing page](https://signalwire.com/pricing/messaging).
