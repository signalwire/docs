## Change a SignalWire Space URL or SignalWire Space name

Currently, SignalWireâ€™s infrastructure is unable to allow for the changing of URLs. 
All Space attributes are tied to the Space URL. 
However, if you must change a SignalWire Space URL, please create a new Space on [our website](https://signalwire.com/) and open a Support ticket. 
SignalWire's Support Team will navigate through the process of releasing and/or transferring phone numbers from a previous Space and delete the old Space when the release/transfer is complete.

Your Space Name is a friendly name that can be changed. 
This is the name that will appear on your [Space's sign-in page](https://signalwire.com/signin) to help your users identify the correct Space. 
To change it from your Dashboard, click on the profile icon in the upper right corner and choose **Settings**. 
Choose a new Space name and click the Save button. 

**Please note** that changing the Space name will not change the Space URL. 
Follow the instructions above if that is what you need.

## Change the Space owner's email address

First, invite the email address of the new owner to join your SignalWire Space.  

import { LiaUserPlusSolid } from "react-icons/lia";

<CardGroup rows={4}>
<Card title="Invite a new user" href="/platform/dashboard/guides/user-management" icon={<LiaUserPlusSolid />}>
Guide to inviting a user to your SignalWire Space
</Card>
</CardGroup>

Once the email address of the new user has been added to the Space, please request the current Space owner to give written consent
through a support ticket, giving information about the User (name and email address), to be changed to the new owner. 
The Space owner by default is the individual that created the Space.

:::info Notice

For security reasons, you must go through a Support ticket to change the Space owner's email address.
