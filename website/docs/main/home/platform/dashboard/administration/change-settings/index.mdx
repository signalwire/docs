## Change a SignalWire Space URL or SignalWire Space name

Currently, SignalWire’s infrastructure is unable to allow for the changing of URLs. 
All Space attributes are tied to the Space URL. 
However, if you must change a SignalWire Space URL, please create a new Space on [our website](https://signalwire.com/) and open a Support ticket. 
SignalWire's Support Team will navigate through the process of releasing and/or transferring phone numbers from a previous Space and delete the old Space when the release/transfer is complete.

Your Space Name is a friendly name that can be changed. 
This is the name that will appear on your [Space's sign-in page](https://signalwire.com/signin) to help your users identify the correct Space. 
To change it from your Dashboard, click on the profile icon in the upper right corner and choose **Settings**. 
Choose a new Space name and click the Save button. 

**Please note** that changing the Space name will not change the Space URL. 
Follow the instructions above if that is what you need.

## Change the Space owner's email address

First, invite the email address of the new owner to join your SignalWire Space.  

import { LiaUserPlusSolid } from "react-icons/lia";

<CardGroup rows={4}>
<Card title="Invite a new user" href="/platform/dashboard/guides/user-management" icon={<LiaUserPlusSolid />}>
Guide to inviting a user to your SignalWire Space
</Card>
</CardGroup>

Once the email address of the new user has been added to the Space, please request the current Space owner to give written consent
through a support ticket, giving information about the User (name and email address), to be changed to the new owner. 
The Space owner by default is the individual that created the Space.

:::info Notice

For security reasons, you must go through a Support ticket to change the Space owner's email address.
