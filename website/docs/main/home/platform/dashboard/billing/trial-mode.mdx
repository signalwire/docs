## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why was my credit card declined?">
    SignalWire accepts all major credit and debit cards through our processor. 
    If your card is declined:
    - Check with your issuer that your credit card is active and valid.
    - Check that the billing address matches what is on file with your issuer.
    - If you are using a VPN or corporate firewall, try clearing your cache or connecting through a different network, then remove the card and add it again.

  <Accordion title="How does Auto Top-Up work?">
    For new accounts, [Auto Top-Up](/platform/dashboard/guides/how-to-set-auto-top-up-by-credit-card) 
    will be enabled with a $10 minimum top-up amount when a credit card is added. 
    If you plan to use your SignalWire account for production traffic, you should check your Top-up settings to ensure you do not run out of funds.
