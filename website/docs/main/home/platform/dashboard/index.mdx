From the Dashboard, you can quickly create new 
[Resources](/platform/call-fabric/resources) 
using the **Create** grid.
Existing Resources are summarized in a list, which can be sorted by Resource type.
The Dashboard also visualizes recent usage data for Voice, Video, and Messaging in charts so you can monitor your usage at a glance.
