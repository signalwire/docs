<Subtitle>Resources on the Call Fabric platform</Subtitle>

## About

SIP Gateways are a simple but powerful Resource type that forward calls to external SIP addresses.

:::tip 
SIP Gateways are designed to route calls to external SIP Addresses.
They are distinct from [SIP Domain Applications](/voice/getting-started/sip/sip-domain-applications), which route inbound calls to SignalWire SIP addresses,
and [SIP Endpoints](/voice/sip/get-started), which are for registering your devices to SignalWire SIP addresses.
