# Resources

Resources are the primary entities for communication within the Call Fabric ecosystem.
They are the building blocks of the system, representing the various communication elements
that can be used to interact with 
[subscribers](/platform/call-fabric#subscribers). 



## Manage Resources

### With the REST API

Use the Resources endpoints to manage your Resources programmatically.

### In the Dashboard

The Dashboard is your unified command center for your SignalWire Space. Access it at `{your-space-name}.signalwire.com`.

After selecting a Resource, 
enter the details for the Resource on a new page,
and select <kbd>Create</kbd> to confirm.

#### Modify or delete

From the Resources page in your SignalWire Dashboard, select the desired Resource to open a detailed view.
Here, by selecting the `Edit` button, you can alter the specifics of the Resource.
