<Subtitle>Resources on the Call Fabric platform</Subtitle>

## About

Relay Applications are powerful applications running on your own server or a client such as a browser or mobile application,
built with one of the [Server or Client Relay SDKs](/sdks/).
Use a Relay Application Resource to connect your Relay Application to SignalWire via a secure realtime websocket connection.
