# Call Flows

<Subtitle>Resources on the Call Fabric platform</Subtitle>

## About

The Call Flow Resource type is used to create and manage visual, no-code voice applications.
Call Flows are created using a simple drag-and-drop interface (the [Call Flow Builder][call-flow-builder]) that generates 
[SWML (SignalWire Markup Language)](/swml) under the hood, 
providing all the power of SWML with an intuitive visual editor.

Call Flows allow you to create complex call routing logic with multiple branches and decision points,
all represented as connected nodes in a visual tree structure.
