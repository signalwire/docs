# Get started

<Subtitle>The SignalWire platform</Subtitle>

SignalWire is a programmable unified communications platform that unifies voice, messaging, video, and AI into a single control plane.
SignalWire's APIs and SDKs enable developers to build state-of-the-art realtime communication experiences without needing to
manage complex telecom infrastructure or stitch together disconnected tools.

This guide will help you set up your account, explore the core APIs, and launch your first application.

## Your SignalWire Space

<div className="row">
  <div className="col col--6">
    When you [create a SignalWire account](https://signalwire.com/signup), you also create a **Space**,
    like `spacename.signalwire.com`.
    Your [Dashboard](https://my.signalwire.com) is located at that subdomain.
    In your Dashboard, you can:

    - Buy and configure phone numbers
    - Create and manage your applications
    - View call logs and analytics
    - Access your API credentials
    - Set up AI agents, call flows, and more

## Core concepts

### Communication channels

SignalWire supports the following communication channels:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Voice" href="/voice" icon={<FaPhone />}>
    Phone calls, IVRs, recording, conferencing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Video" href="/video" icon={<FaVideo />}>
    Video rooms, screen sharing, recordings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Messaging" href="/messaging" icon={<MdMessage />}>
    SMS and MMS text messages
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat" href="/chat" icon={<FaComments />}>
    Real-time chat for web and mobile apps
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI" href="/ai" icon={<FaRobot />}>
    Intelligent voice agents powered by LLMs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fax" href="/fax" icon={<FaFax />}>
    Send and receive faxes programmatically
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Most channels can work over different **transports** depending on how you want to connect:

| Transport | What it is | Common uses |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **PSTN** | The traditional phone network | Calling regular phone numbers, receiving calls from landlines and cell phones |
| **SIP** | Voice over IP protocol | Connecting PBX systems, desk phones, softphones, and VoIP carriers |
| **WebRTC** | Browser-based real-time communication | In-app calling, video conferencing, browser-based contact centers |

For example, a voice call could come in via PSTN (someone dialing your number), SIP (from a desk phone), or WebRTC (from your web app).
**SignalWire will handle all three.**

### Phone numbers

To make or receive calls and messages through the phone network, you'll need SignalWire phone numbers. 
You can buy local numbers, toll-free numbers, or short codes directly from your Dashboard or the 
[API](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/phone-numbers).

Each number can be configured to handle incoming calls and messages differently - 
whether that's forwarding to another number, running a script, connecting to an AI agent, 
or triggering your own application.

<Card title="Learn more about Phone Numbers" href="/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number" horizontal>
  How to buy, configure, and manage your numbers
</Card>

We also offer the option of purchasing phone numbers programmatically via our [Purchase a Phone Number](rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/purchase-phone-number) API Endpoint.

### Resources

In SignalWire, a **Resource** is anything that can handle communications - an AI agent, a script, a SIP connection, or your own application. 
When a call or message comes in, you tell SignalWire which Resource should handle it.

Common resource types include:
- **SWML Scripts** - Simple JSON/YAML instructions hosted in your Dashboard
- **AI Agents** - Conversational AI that handles calls autonomously
- **Call Flows** - Visual drag-and-drop call routing
- **Relay Applications** - Your own server applications connected via WebSocket

<Card title="Learn more about Resources" href="/platform/call-fabric/resources" horizontal>
  Understanding the different resource types
</Card>

### Addresses

Every Resource has an **Address**.
This is a unique identifier that lets you target and interact with it. 
Think of addresses as the **phone number** for any resource, but broader in scope.

Addresses can be:
- **Phone numbers** - Traditional numbers like `+14155551234` for PSTN calls
- **SIP addresses** - For VoIP connections like `sip:user@domain.com`
- **Aliases** - Custom names like `/support-queue` or `/main-conference` that are easy to remember

A single Resource can have multiple addresses, and you can change them anytime. 
For example, you might point both a phone number and a custom alias to the same AI agent.

<Card title="Learn more about Addresses" href="/platform/call-fabric/addresses" horizontal>
  How addressing works in SignalWire
</Card>

### Subscribers

**Subscribers** are end users who authenticate with SignalWire to make and receive calls. 
If you're building a contact center, business phone system, or video conferencing app for example, your users become Subscribers.

SignalWire manages these users for you. You create, update, and delete them through our REST APIs, and each Subscriber gets:
- **Authentication** - Secure credentials and tokens for logging in
- **A callable address** - They can be reached directly at `/private/username`
- **Multi-device support** - They can answer calls from a browser, mobile app, or desk phone

This means you don't have to build user management, authentication, or device registration yourself - SignalWire handles it.

## Start building

Now that you understand the basics, let's figure out the best way for you to build. 
The right approach depends on what you're creating and how you prefer to work.

### What are you trying to build?

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="AI Application" defaultOpen>

**You want to build an AI-powered voice agent that handles phone calls.**

This is common for:
- Automated customer service
- Appointment scheduling and reminders
- FAQ bots and information lines
- Lead qualification and surveys
- Virtual receptionists

**[Agents SDK](/sdks/agents-sdk)** - A Python framework for building sophisticated AI voice agents.
You get full control over prompts, custom functions (SWAIG) dedicated to AI, customizeable conversation flow, and seamless LLM integration.
Best for complex agents that need to perform actions like booking appointments, looking up data, or integrating with your systems.

**[AI Agent (Dashboard)](/ai/get-started)** - Configure an AI agent directly in your Dashboard without writing code.
Set up prompts, choose a voice, add functions, and connect it to a phone number.
Great for getting started quickly or simpler use cases.

**[SWML with AI](/swml/methods/ai)** - Add AI capabilities to your SWML scripts using the `ai` method.
Good when you want AI as part of a larger call flow that includes other logic.

    AI in call flows
  </Card>

  <Card title="Dashboard AI Agent" href="/ai/get-started">
    No-code setup
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Quick start with Agents SDK:

```bash
pip install signalwire-agents
```

```python
from signalwire_agents import AgentBase

class MyAgent(AgentBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="Assistant", route="/agent")
        self.prompt_add_section("main", body="You are a helpful assistant for Acme Corp.")

agent = MyAgent()
agent.serve()
```

</Card>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Browser or Mobile App">

**You want voice, video, or chat directly in a web browser or mobile app.**

This is common for:
- Click-to-call buttons on websites
- In-app voice or video calling
- Browser-based contact centers
- Video conferencing applications

**[Browser SDK](/sdks/browser-sdk)** - Our JavaScript SDK for building custom WebRTC experiences.
You get full control over the UI and user experience. Best when you need video conferencing, custom calling interfaces, or real-time chat.

**[Click-to-Call](/tools/c2c)** - A pre-built widget you can drop onto any website.
Users click a button and call you directly from their browser. Minimal code required - great for adding a "call us" button quickly.

<Card title="Browser SDK Guide" href="/sdks/browser-sdk" horizontal>
  Build voice, video, and chat in the browser
</Card>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Server Application">

**You're building a backend service that handles calls or messages.**

This is common for:
- IVR systems and phone menus
- Automated call routing
- SMS notifications and two-factor auth
- Call centers and support systems
- AI voice agents

#### Do you need real-time control?

**If you need simple call handling** (IVRs, call forwarding, playing messages), use **[SWML](/swml)**.
Your server responds to webhooks with JSON/YAML instructions. It's stateless, works with any programming language, and is the simplest approach for most use cases.

**If you need real-time control** (live call monitoring, mid-call transfers, complex orchestration), use the **[Realtime SDK](/sdks/realtime-sdk)**.
It maintains a persistent WebSocket connection for instant, bi-directional communication.
Best for applications that need to react to events as they happen.

**If you're building AI voice agents**, use the **[Agents SDK](/sdks/agents-sdk)**.
It's a Python framework specifically designed for creating conversational AI that handles phone calls.
It handles the complexity of integrating with LLMs and managing conversations.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No-Code / Low-Code">

**You want to build without writing much (or any) code.**

This is common for quick prototypes, simple IVRs, and small businesses needing basic call handling.

**[Call Flow Builder](/call-flow-builder)** - A visual, drag-and-drop interface for building call handling logic. No code required.
You connect nodes to define what happens when someone calls - play a message, gather input, route to different people, etc.

**[SWML Scripts](/swml)** - Write simple JSON or YAML scripts directly in your Dashboard.
It's not quite "no code" but it's very low code, and you don't need to run any servers. SignalWire hosts the scripts for you.

**[AI Agent](/ai/get-started)** - Configure a conversational AI agent through your Dashboard. Set up prompts, choose a voice, and connect it to a phone number.
The AI handles conversations autonomously.

#### Quick start for no-code:

1. **Buy a phone number** - Go to Phone Numbers in your Dashboard
2. **Create a Call Flow** - Use Call Flow Builder to design what happens when someone calls
3. **Assign it to your number** - Edit the number settings and select your Call Flow
4. **Call your number** - Test it out!

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Migrating from Twilio">

**You have an existing Twilio application and want to move to SignalWire.**

Good news, SignalWire's **[Compatibility API](/compatibility-api)** is designed as a drop-in replacement. 
In most cases, you can switch by changing a few lines of code.

#### What's compatible:

| Twilio | SignalWire |
|--------|------------|
| TwiML | [cXML](/compatibility-api/cxml) (same syntax) |
| REST API | [Compatibility REST API](/rest/compatibility-api/overview) |
| Helper Libraries | [Compatibility SDKs](/compatibility-api/sdks) (Node, Python, Ruby, C#) |
| Account SID | Project ID |
| Auth Token | API Token |

:::warning heads up
With [one small exception](/compatibility-api/cxml/stream-openai-realtime), AI is **not supported** in the Compatibility API.
Check out the **AI Application** section instead.
:::

#### Migration steps:

1. **Create a SignalWire account** at [signalwire.com/signup](https://signalwire.com/signup)
2. **Get your credentials** from Dashboard > API > API Tokens
3. **Update your code** to use SignalWire's SDK and credentials
4. **Update webhook URLs** if needed (cXML syntax is identical to TwiML)
5. **[Buy](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number) or [port](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/porting-into-signalwire) phone numbers** to SignalWire
6. **Test** your application

```javascript
// Change from this (Twilio)
const twilio = require("twilio");
const client = twilio(ACCOUNT_SID, AUTH_TOKEN);

// To this (SignalWire)
const { RestClient } = require("@signalwire/compatibility-api");
const client = RestClient(PROJECT_ID, API_TOKEN, {
  signalwireSpaceUrl: "your-space.signalwire.com"
});
```
