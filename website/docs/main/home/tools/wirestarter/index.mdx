# **Introduction to WireStarter**

WireStarter is a Docker container which sets up the SignalWire SDKs and builds a development and testing environment for new developers.

WireStarter includes SWSH (the SignalWire interactive Shell) by default.
SWSH is a scriptable utility built to easily configure and manage SignalWire Spaces from a command-line environment.
{/* Learn more by reading our [introduction to SWSH](/tools/swsh/). */}

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **A free [SignalWire Account](https://signalwire.com/signup)**
- **SignalWire API Credentials:**
Copy your Project ID and API Token from the 
[API tab](https://my.signalwire.com?page=credentials) of your SignalWire Dashboard.
- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** 

If you intend to set up an example application, you'll also need to
[install ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/#step-1-install)
and create a free [ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).

---

## **Installation**

The instructions for installing WireStarter using Docker are universal and will work on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

The script we run in step 3 will ask for your 
SignalWire Space ID, 
SignalWire Project ID, 
SignalWire Project Token, 
ngrok Token, and 
ngrok Args (optional - mostly for custom domains), 
so make sure you have that information handy by opening the 
SignalWire ['tokens' page](https://my.signalwire.com?page=credentials) 
and the ngrok ['Your Authtoken' page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

Repeat these instructions anytime you need to start WireStarter again.

<Steps>

### Start Docker Desktop

Docker must be running at the start of the process.

### Download, install, and run WireStarter

WireStarter is frequently updated. 
If you've used WireStarter before, be sure to delete the previous version
(using the Docker Desktop UI or the command line)
and reinstall the latest version of the container.

```shell
docker run -it -d --rm --name wirestarter briankwest/wirestarter:latest
```

This Docker command downloads and installs WireStarter (if it isn't already installed).
It then runs the container in the background and automatically removes it on exit.

### Start SWSH

This command starts a terminal UI which will prompt you for relevant IDs and tokens.
It will walk you through configuring the development and testing environment so you can quickly deploy and test our 
[example applications](https://github.com/signalwire/digital_employees). 
It then automatically enters SWSH (SignalWire Shell), the official SignalWire CLI.

Follow the prompts on screen to enter your SignalWire Space, Project ID, and API token.
Your SignalWire Space is the subdomain that prefixes `.signalwire.com`.
In other words, if your Dashboard is accessed at `https://spacename.signalwire.com/dashboard`,
you should enter `spacename` when prompted for your Space.
Copy the Project ID and REST API token from the
[API pane](https://my.signalwire.com?page=credentials) of your SignalWire Dashboard.

```shell
docker exec -ti wirestarter bash 
```

<figure>
    <img 
      className="img-600" 
      src={require("./wirestarter-space.webp").default} 
      alt="A screenshot of the WireStarter interface. The user is prompted to enter their SignalWire Space domain."
    />
</figure>

When prompted, select your preferred editor: nano, vim, or emacs. 
We recommend nano for beginners.

Copy the SignalWire Space ID, Project ID, and Project token from [the API pane](https://my.signalwire.com?page=credentials) of your SignalWire Dashboard.
Copy the ngrok Token from the [Your Authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) ngrok page.
ngrok Args are optional and only needed if you want to use a custom ngrok domain name. If not, leave the text field blank and proceed.

:::tip ngrok prompts
If you don't plan to set up a WireStarter example application, you can safely ignore both ngrok prompts by leaving them blank and hitting **Enter** or **Return**.

Learn more about WireStarter by visiting its [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/signalwire/WireStarter).

### Optional: Buy and set up a phone number

After entering the SignalWire and ngrok information in the previous step, you will enter the [SWSH CLI](/tools/swsh/). 
If you already have a number set up in your Space that you want to use, you can skip this step.

:::warning Name your numbers!
Phone numbers purchased in the Dashboard UI must be named before being assigned to these demos. 
Any name will work — just edit and save the populated number as its own name. Numbers purchased in SWSH are not affected by this limitation.
:::

<figure>
  <img 
    className="img-600" 
    src={require("./swsh.webp").default} 
    alt="A screenshot of the SWSH terminal."
  />
</figure>

Purchase and configure a phone number using the **`phone_number`** command.

Enter `help` or `help -v` to view more options for SWSH.

You can also purchase a phone number in the Web UI in your [SignalWire Space](https://my.signalwire.com?page=phone_numbers).

<figure>
    <img 
      className="img-800" 
      src={require("./number-purchased.webp").default} 
      alt="Screenshot of a purchased phone number."
    />

</figure>

### Set Startup Variables

Set the following variables from the same bash prompt in order to streamline startup. 
These variables are required for running SWSH in Non-Interactive mode.
If they are not set, SWSH will ask for them at startup.

<div class="row">
<div class="col col--6">
```bash title="Linux / MacOS"
export PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
export SIGNALWIRE_SPACE=<YOUR_SIGNALWIRE_SPACE>
export REST_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_REST_API_TOKEN>
```
</div>
<div class="col col--6">
```bash title="Windows"
setx PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
setx SIGNALWIRE_SPACE=<YOUR_SIGNALWIRE_SPACE>
setx REST_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_REST_API_TOKEN>
```
</div>
</div>

Learn more by reading our [Introduction to SWSH](/tools/swsh).

### Build an Example Application

Follow these instructions to build and test an [example application](https://github.com/signalwire/digital_employees/tree/main)!

**Run `exit` to Exit SWSH**

Once WireStarter is successfully configured, and you've purchased any numbers with SWSH, 
run `exit` once to exit SWSH.

<div class="row">
    
    <div class="col col--6">

        **Run `setup.sh`**

        From the same bash prompt, run `setup.sh` and select a demo.
        Follow the instructions to assign a phone number and finish setup.

        If you encounter any problems using WireStarter, please let us know by 
        [reporting an issue on its GitHub repo](https://github.com/signalwire/WireStarter/issues).

        You can also get live support in the [Community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/F2WNYTNjuF), or by emailing devex@signalwire.com.
