# Gather Input

This node is used to gather input from the caller using DTMF or speech recognition.
During the gather period, the call can use an audio file or text-to-speech to prompt the caller to enter the input.

Multiple input options can be configured to gather multiple pieces of information from the caller using the `Add option` button.
Additionally, actions can be taken based on the input received. 
For every input option you can configure, an output node connection will be created to handle the input received.

## **Examples**

### Simple Input

You can choose to accept both Speech and DTMF tones with your IVR. 
The caller in this example can either press 1 or say “sales” to connect with the sales line.

### Input with infinite loop prevention

If you plan to loop your “No Input” route, you probably want to disconnect a call if the Gather Input node attempts to loop the call more than 2 times. 
You can do that with a combination of a [Set Variables](../set_variables/index.mdx) node 
and a [Conditions](../conditions/index.mdx) node.
If a caller dials your number and sits on the line in silence, your Flow will disconnect the call after a couple of loops.

### Accept any speech option

The “Unknown” route from the Gather Input node can be useful if you want to accept any and all speech recognition from your caller. 
A word or phrase is required in your Option 1 “Or Says” field so that your Gather Input node knows it is collecting speech. 

You can route that option to the same flow as the “Unknown” route so all speech options continue the same path. 
The variable `%{prompt_value}` can then be used in any node and will contain all speech that was detected.
