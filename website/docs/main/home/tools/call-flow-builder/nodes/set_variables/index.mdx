# Set Variables

Use this node to set variables that can be accessed from other nodes in the Call Flow.

The value can be a static value set as a string ("value"), 
a variable from another node such as a request response ( `%{request_response.<object_field>}` ), 
or a call parameter ( `%{call.from} `).

Access these variables in other blocks with `%{<Key>}` and unset variables with the [Unset Variables](../unset_variables/index.mdx) node.

For a more in-depth explanation of using variables, see the
[Using Variables](/call-flow-builder/variables)
section of our introduction to Call Flow Builder.

| **Key**      | The name of the variable to set.                                                                                 |
| **Value**    | The value to set the variable to. This can be a static value, a variable from another node, or a call parameter. |

## **Example**

Use Set Variables if you plan to use multiple 
[Request](../request/index.mdx) 
nodes in the same Flow and you need the variables to carry across the entire Flow.

This example makes a request to an API for temperature and location.
The requestâ€™s response is saved in variables called `my_temperature` and `my_location`.

In order to make a new request to a new webhook, the Set Variables node is essential because
the second Request node will overwrite the `request_response`.
Your first variables will remain accessible using `%{vars.my_temperature}` and `%{vars.my_location}`.
