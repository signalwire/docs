# Unset Variables

The Unset Variables is used to clear any variable that was set using [Set Variables](../set_variables/index.mdx).
All currently set variables are populated in the dropdown menu.
You can unset multiple variables in one node by selecting multiple variables from the dropdown menu.

## Example

In the example below, we answer the call and set a variable `from_number` with the value
of the caller's number. We then play a message to the caller and unset the `from_number` variable.
