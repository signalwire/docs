## **Examples**

### Forward to SIP

In order to dial a SIP endpoint, format the **To** field with with “sip:” followed by the endpoint’s address. 
For example:

**To:** `sip:alice@example.com`

If the endpoint is unavailable, the flow will follow one of the four failed routes depending on the SIP signaling that is received. 
You can give individual actions for each signal, or route them all back into the same node.

### Forward to multiple SIP endpoints and phone

You can combine SIP dialing and Phone number dialing in the same node. 
The example below is set to `Sequential` dialing, so the sales endpoint will first ring for 20 seconds.
After that, the call will ring the support endpoint for 20 more seconds before finally dialing out to +15552223333.
