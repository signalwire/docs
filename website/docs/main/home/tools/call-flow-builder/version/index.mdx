<Subtitle>Call Flow Builder</Subtitle>

## Introduction

Call Flow Builder offers built-in versioning.
This feature empowers users to test different configurations of a Call Flow without affecting the live version,
and to revert to a previous version if needed.

Once a Call Flow has been created, you can click on the `Version History` button located in the top left corner of the Call Flow Builder interface.
This will open a panel showing all the versions of the call flow, along with a timestamp of when the version was created.

## Deploy a new version

If you wish to make edits to a call flow, you can create a new version making any changes you need.
Once you are satisfied with the new version, you can click the `Deploy` button to make the new version the live version of the call flow.
When a new version is saved, it will add a new entry to the version history. The name of the
version will be `+1` from the previous version. E.g. `Version 1.0`, `Version 2.0`, `Version 3.0`, etc.
