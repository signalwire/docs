# **Introduction to SWSH**

SWSH (**S**ignal**W**ire interactive **SH**ell)
is a command line utility written in Python to interface with SignalWire APIs.
SWSH is built to easily configure and manage SignalWire Spaces from a command-line environment.  

SWSH is extremely useful in scripting contexts, and allows the user to
perform repeated tasks quickly and efficiently by passing commands into SWSH.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **A free [SignalWire Account](https://signalwire.com/signup)**
- **SignalWire API Credentials:**
Copy your Project ID and API Token from the 
[API tab](https://my.signalwire.com?page=credentials) of your SignalWire Dashboard.
- **[Python 3 (or later)](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download):** 
Python is required to install SWSH in a standalone manner.
- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** 
is required for installing SWSH as a part of the SignalWire WireStarter container.
Docker is *not* required for installing the standalone Python package.

---

## **Installation**

SWSH can be installed in two ways.

1. [**Standalone:**](#standalone) If you wish to use SWSH by itself, install its Python package.
2. [**With WireStarter:**](#wirestarter) SWSH can also be installed with our WireStarter Docker container, 
which also sets up the SignalWire SDKs and sets up a convenient development and testing environment.


### Standalone Installation {#standalone}


<Tabs groupId="swsh-standalone">

{/*Unix Installation Instructions*/}

<TabItem value="unix" label="MacOS or Linux" default>

<br/>

Install SWSH standalone if you're looking for a scriptable SignalWire CLI without the additional development and testing features provided by WireStarter.

Python3 is required for the SWSH standalone installation.
We also recommend using the python3 `venv` module, but it isn't required.

1. **Create a new Python virtual environment**

This command uses the `venv` module to create a new Python virtual environment named "swsh". 
Before running it, navigate to the directory where you wish to store the swsh virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv swsh
```

2. **Activate the SWSH virtual environment**

This command activates the `swsh` virtual environment you just created. 
This changes your shell's environment to use the Python and pip binaries within this environment, 
isolating your Python setup from the system-wide Python installation. 

```bash
source swsh/bin/activate
```

3. **Install SWSH**

This command installs the swsh package and its dependencies inside the activated virtual environment.

:::note
We're aware of an issue with Python 3.12 causing dependency issues.
Avoid these issues by specifying version 3.11 for pip.
:::

```bash
pip3.11 install swsh
```

4. **Start the SWSH command prompt**  

Now that SWSH is installed, you can start a shell with it by running:

```
swsh
```


{/*Windows Installation Instructions*/}

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

<br/>

Install SWSH on your Windows system using Command Prompt or PowerShell.
Python3 is required for the SWSH standalone installation.
We also recommend using the python3 `venv` module, but it isn't required.

1. **Create a new Python virtual environment**

This command uses the `venv` module to create a new Python virtual environment named "swsh".
Before running it, navigate to the directory where you wish to store the swsh virtual environment.

```cmd
python3 -m venv swsh
```

2. **Activate the SWSH virtual environment**

Activation of the virtual environment requires different commands in Command Prompt and PowerShell.

<Tabs groupId="win-shells">

<TabItem value="swsh-cmd" label="Command Prompt">

```cmd
swsh\Scripts\activate
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="swsh-pwr" label="PowerShell">

```powershell
swsh\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

3. **Install SWSH**

This command installs the swsh package and its dependencies inside the activated virtual environment.

```cmd
pip install swsh
```

4. **Start the SWSH command prompt**  

Now that SWSH is installed, you can start a shell with it by running:

```
swsh
```

Follow the prompts on screen to enter your SignalWire Space, Project ID, and API token.
Your SignalWire Space is the subdomain that prefixes `signalwire.com`.
If your Dashboard is accessed at `https://spacename.signalwire.com/dashboard`,
you should enter `spacename` when prompted for your Space.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### WireStarter (Docker Image) Installation {#wirestarter}

WireStarter is a Docker container which sets up the SignalWire SDKs and builds a development and testing environment for new developers.
Install SWSH with WireStarter if you want to take advantage of WireStarter's features.

The instructions for installing WireStarter using Docker are universal and will work on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

1. **Start Docker Desktop**

Docker must be running at the start of the process.

2. **Download and install WireStarter**

WireStarter has been updated recently. 
If you've used WireStarter before, be sure to delete the previous version and reinstall the latest version of the container.

```shell
docker run --name wirestarter briankwest/wirestarter:latest
```

3. **Start SWSH**

This command starts a terminal UI which will prompt you for relevant IDs and tokens.
It will walk you through configuring the development and testing environment.
It then automatically enters SWSH.

Follow the prompts on screen to enter your SignalWire Space, Project ID, and API token.
Your SignalWire Space is the subdomain that prefixes `signalwire.com`.
If your Dashboard is accessed at `https://spacename.signalwire.com/dashboard`,
you should enter `spacename` when prompted for your Space.
Copy the Project ID and REST API token from the
[API pane](https://my.signalwire.com?page=credentials) of your SignalWire Dashboard.

:::tip
If you don't plan to set up a WireStarter example application, you can safely ignore both ngrok prompts by leaving them blank and hitting **Enter** or **Return**.
:::

```shell
docker exec -ti wirestarter bash 
```

Learn more about WireStarter by visiting its [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/signalwire/WireStarter).

## **Running SWSH**

Now that SWSH is installed, you can run it at any time by entering this command:

```bash
swsh
```

The Project ID, API Token, and API Key must be correctly configured in order to use SWSH commands.

### Startup Variables

The following variables can be set to streamline startup.  
They are also required for running in Non-Interactive mode.
If they are not set, SWSH will ask for them at startup.

**Linux / MacOS:**

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
export SIGNALWIRE_SPACE=<YOUR_SIGNALWIRE_SPACE>
export REST_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_REST_API_TOKEN>
```

**Windows:**

```bash
setx PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
setx SIGNALWIRE_SPACE=<YOUR_SIGNALWIRE_SPACE>
setx REST_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_REST_API_TOKEN>
```

---

## **Commands**

This section defines all SWSH commands. Commands can be run interactively or non-interactively. 

#### Interactive Commands  

Interactive commands are done within the SWSH shell itself.
For example:

1.  Type `swsh` to enter the shell
2.  Enter the following command: `phone_number list`

#### Scriptable (Non-Interactive) Commands

This type of command can be passed into SWSH, allowing for the output from SWSH to be passed back to the main shell.
This type of SWSH command is ideal for scripting.
[Startup variables](#startup-variables) must be set in order to enable scriptable commands.

Scriptable commands use the same syntax as Interactive commands, but condensed into a single line.
For example:

```bash
swsh phone_number list
```
