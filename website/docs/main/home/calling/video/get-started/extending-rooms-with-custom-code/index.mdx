# Extending Rooms with Custom Code

If you are using [video rooms with UI included](/video/conference), you don't need to write code: you
get a basic video conference out-of-the-box. However, this doesn't stop you in
case you need additional control via code. Let's see how.

## Obtaining a reference to the RoomSession

The code snippet that you copy from your SignalWire Space looks like this:

```html
<script>
  // ... code ...
  // ... code ...
  // ... code ...
  SignalWire.AppKit.VideoConference({
    token: "vpt_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    // userName: 'your-name',
  });
</script>
```

Notice how the final part of the snippet is a call which takes a set of
parameters that you can use to initialize the room session. Find the full list
of parameters in the [documentation](/video/conference/technical-reference).

Here we are interested in the `setupRoomSession` parameter: this is a callback
which will be invoked when a [`RoomSession`][roomsession] object is ready. This
normally happens right before the room is joined.

```html
<script>
  // ... code ...
  // ... code ...
  // ... code ...
  SignalWire.AppKit.VideoConference({
    token: "vpt_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    setupRoomSession: (roomSession) => {
      console.log("A RoomSession object is now available.");
      console.log("The room is about to be joined.");
    },
  });
</script>
```

## Using the RoomSession object

Once you obtained the reference to the [`RoomSession`][roomsession] object, you
can start subscribing to events and performing actions.

Say we want to mute the user as soon as they join the room. First, we would
subscribe to the
[`room.joined`](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session#roomjoined)
event, which will trigger right after the room has been joined. Then, we would
invoke the
[`videoMute`](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session#videomute)
method to mute the local user. For example:

```html
<script>
  // ... code ...
  // ... code ...
  // ... code ...
  SignalWire.AppKit.VideoConference({
    token: "vpt_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    setupRoomSession: (roomSession) => {
      // Mute the video of the current user as soon as they join.
      roomSession.on("room.joined", () => roomSession.videoMute());
    },
  });
</script>
```

## Wrap up

In video rooms with prebuilt UI, you can use the `setupRoomSession` parameter to
access the underlying API which gives you full control on the room. Use it to
subscribe to events or to perform actions in the room.

If, instead of a widget, you require a more advanced control on the room (such as a custom UI,
or a custom authentication mechanism), take a look at [First steps with Video](../video-first-steps/index.mdx). It will show you how to write a custom video
application from scratch using our lower level APIs.
