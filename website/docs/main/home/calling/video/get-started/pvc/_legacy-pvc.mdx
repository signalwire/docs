<Steps>

### Open the Video tab {#overview}

In this tab of your SignalWire Dashboard, you can visually track your Video API usage over the previous week 
by total minutes, cost, and video quality with the usage graphs. 
Under the charts, you will find two helpful links to create videoconference rooms via different methods.

<img src={require("@image/dashboard/legacy/pvc/97db962-sw-space-video-page.png").default} className="img-800" />

### Create a video room

Both links under the graph will take you to a form to create a **New Video Conference Room**. 
You have the choice to create a new room with a pre-built UI or without. 
The pre-built UI option is a pre-built videoconferencing room that you can use 
with no coding required beyond copy-pasting a code snippet into your application. 

The second option will create the same kind of video room created programmatically 
with a `POST` request to `<YOUR SPACE>.signalwire.com/api/video/rooms`. 

### Copy embed code

After selecting your room type, click on the dropdown menu next to
**Moderator Embed Code** and click on **Guest Embed Code** to copy the code. 
A screen like the following will open:

<Frame caption="Guest Embed Code Snippet">
  ![the Guest Embed Code dialog. Users can copy the provided embed code.](@image/video/guest-embed-code.webp)
</Frame>

You can copy either the code for guests, or the code for accessing the room with moderator permissions. 
See the [Conferences menu](#video-conferences) reference for a detailed explanation of the different copyable fields.

### Embed the room

Your video room is ready for use!
Refer to the [main guide's instructions](/video/conference#embed) to embed your new room on your website.

</Steps>

### Logs menu {#logs}

<img src={require("@image/dashboard/legacy/pvc/f2927e5-sw-space-video-logs.png").default} className="img-800" />

This tab is where you can find a detailed list of all video room sessions. This includes Video Conference rooms as well as API rooms. 
If a video session is in progress, hovering over the "In Progress" status will display the room preview as long as previews are enabled. 
Clicking on a session opens even more details on the room session including all of the room settings and members.

### Conferences menu {#video-conferences}

Here is where all of your existing Video Conference rooms are listed. 

<img
  src={require("@image/dashboard/legacy/pvc/1a1898d-sw-space-video-conferences.jpg").default}
  className="img-800"
/>

Selecting an existing room will open its detailed settings, which you can change as often as you like. 
Be sure to click the save button at the bottom to save any changes. 
You will also see a room preview here if there is a video session in progress.

<Frame caption="Overview screen for a Video Conference.">
![Video Conference overview showing room description, participant count, and moderator controls.](@image/video/conference-overview.webp)
</Frame>

On the right, you see a preview of the room's content. 
Note that this will be enabled only if you have enabled room previews.
On the left, you find buttons for using your room.

#### Copyable fields

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Join Room As Moderator">
    Pressing this button allows you to join the video room with moderator permissions. 
    Pressing the downwards arrow lets you join with guest permissions instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Copy Moderator Link">
    Pressing this button copies a link for joining the room with moderator permissions. 
    Pressing the downwards arrow lets you copy the link for joining with guest permissions instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Moderator Embed Code">
    Pressing this button copies a code snippet for embedding the video room into any web page. 
  By default, the code snippet will make users join with moderator permissions. 
  Pressing the downwards arrow lets you copy the code for joining with guest permissions instead. 
  You could decide to embed these into different pages of your website, one internal and one accessible by the public.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Copy Moderator Token">
    Pressing this button copies the room token which can be used programmatically to grant access to the room with moderator permissions. 
    Pressing the downwards arrow lets you copy the token for joining with guest permissions instead. 
    You may need these tokens if you alter the embedded code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reset Tokens">
    Pressing this button will reset the security tokens associated with a room. 
    Press this button if you want to disable existing access to the room. 
    Note that resetting the tokens will require you to update all the code snippets and links that you previously shared since they will stop working.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

#### Settings menu {#settings-tab}

In this tab, you will find options to customize how your room is built.

<Frame caption="Configuration options for Video Conferences.">
![Video Conference settings tab with Availability, Quality, Layout, Size, and Record options.](@image/video/conference-settings.png)
</Frame>

**Availability** sets a specific time the room will be accessible. 
If you want to limit accessibility to a specific event time, input the starting and ending date and time using your local format or click on the calendar icon to set them.

**Quality** allows you to set a lower or higher video quality depending on your bandwidth and system capabilities.

**Layout** controls the arrangement of participant video tiles. 
This will be the same layout for all users. 
The default is a responsive grid.

**Size** limits the number of participants allowed to join the room. 
A small size will cap the number of participants at 10, medium size at 50, and large size at 300. 
After the limit is reached, no other participants can join the room.

**Record on Start** starts a recording as soon as the room is opened. 
Recordings are accessible later in the Recordings tab in the Video section of your SignalWire Space.

**Enable Room Preview** allows a short recording of the room content to be recorded and displayed to participants before joining the room.

#### Appearance menu {#appearance-tab}

In this tab, you can customize the colors used in your room. 
There is a color picker for Background, Foreground, Primary, Success Indications, and Error Indications. 
There are two color schemes available: light and dark, and you can change them accordingly so they fit the look of your web page depending on the time of day.
You can use the preview to test out your choices.

You can create a new Video Conference room by clicking the "+ New" blue button on the top right. 
You have the option of creating a room with a prebuilt UI or without. 
If you choose a room with a prebuilt UI, all you need to do is copy the embeddable code from the room's details page and drop it into your application. 
For more information on rooms with a prebuilt UI, see our [Video Conferences guide](/video/conference) and our guide on 
[Integrating Video Conferences With Any Website](/video/conference).

Without the prebuilt UI, you will access the videoconference room through your application with a room token request which includes the room's name.

```js
const options = {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { Accept: "application/json", "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    room_name: "my_room",
    user_name: "John Smith",
    permissions: [" "],
    auto_create_room: true,
    enable_room_previews: true,
    room_display_name: "My Room",
  }),
};

fetch("https://<YOUR SPACE URL>/api/video/room_tokens", options)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((response) => console.log(response))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

You can then use that token to programmatically start a Room Session, join the room, and display the video in the appropriate div in your application. 
You can find a full guide to using a video room like this in the [Simple Video Demo](/video/getting-started/simple-video-demo).

:::info A Note on API Rooms

There are three ways to create API Rooms: from your SignalWire Space, with an API call, or auto-created when a room token is requested for a room that does not yet exist. 
The first two methods create API Rooms that persist and are listed in this Conferences tab of your SignalWire Video page. 
They remain accessible until they are manually deleted. 
However, a room that is auto-created is automatically deleted when it is closed.
