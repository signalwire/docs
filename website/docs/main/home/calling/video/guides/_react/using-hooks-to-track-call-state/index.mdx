# Using Hooks to Track Call State in React and React Native

This article follows either from [Getting Started with Video API in React](../getting-started-video-api-react/index.mdx) or [Getting Started with Video API in React Native](../getting-started-video-api-react-native/index.mdx). Those articles will help you set up a basic "hello world" application in your platform of choice, so if you haven't got a
project setup already, you should start there.

Your video call will need a UI, and it is important that the UI reflect the state of the call. For example, you'd only want to
show the "Unmute" button if the microphone is currently muted. Similarly, you'd want the list of members to change as people come and
go.

The `RoomSession` object allows you to subscribe to events. For example, `RoomSession.on('memberList.updated', callback)` would keep you informed
of the comings and goings of members.

The `<Video>` and the `<VideoConference>` components for React provide props like `onMemberListUpdated` or `onRoomJoined`, which will internally
subscribe to events in the RoomSession. They are used like this: `<Video onMemberListUpdated={callback} token= ... />`.
This provides a powerful way of tracking relevant changes to the room, but it gets tedious to maintain state this way, specially when used within React.

And so the library provides some React Hooks which internally subscribe to events and maintain state, so you can start laying out your UI right away.

## Getting the RoomSession Object

We use the [RoomSession](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/index.mdx) object to stay
informed about changes, and interact with the room. To access the RoomSession object, we would
do something like this:


<Tabs groupId="pvc-vs-sdk">
  <TabItem value="PVC" label="PVC" default>

```jsx title=App.js
import { useState, useCallback } from "react";
import { VideoConference } from "@signalwire-community/react";

export default function DemoVideo() {
  const [roomSession, setRoomSession] = useState(null);
  const onRoomReady = useCallback((rs) => setRoomSession(rs), []);

  return <VideoConference token="PVC Token" onRoomReady={onRoomReady} />;
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Video SDK" label="Video SDK">

```jsx title=App.js
import { useState, useCallback } from "react";
import { Video } from "@signalwire-community/react";

export default function DemoVideo() {
  const [roomSession, setRoomSession] = useState(null);
  const onRoomReady = useCallback((rs) => setRoomSession(rs), []);

  return <Video token="Room Token" onRoomReady={onRoomReady} />;
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you have safely stored the RoomSession object, no matter how you received it, you can start using
the hooks presented below. We will be using the Programmable Video component (`<VideoConference />`
from `@signalwire-community/react`) for React
code examples and the Video Component (`<Video />` from `@signalwire-community/react-native`)
for the React Native code examples.

## Using Hooks to populate UI

With the basic code set up, we can now start placing the UI components, and making them dynamic using
the data from the custom hooks in `@signalwire-community/react`.

The hooks will internally subscribe to relevant events and keep track of state to make sure the information
is always up to date. They will trigger rerenders when necessary to make sure your UI never goes out of sync.

### Rendering the Member List with `useMembers`

First, we will print out the list of members in the room. As members come and go,
your UI will update accordingly.

<Tabs groupId="react-vs-RN">
  <TabItem value="React" label="React" default>

```jsx title=App.js
import { useCallback, useState } from "react";
import { VideoConference, useMembers } from "@signalwire-community/react";

export default function DemoVideo() {
  const [roomSession, setRoomSession] = useState(null);
  const { members } = useMembers(roomSession);
  const onRoomReady = useCallback((rs) => setRoomSession(rs), []);

  return (
    <div style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}>
      <VideoConference token="PVC Token" onRoomReady={onRoomReady} />

      <b>Members: </b>
      <ul>
        {members.map((member) => (
          <li>{member.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ReactNative" label="React Native" default>

```jsx title=App.js
import { useCallback, useState } from "react";
import { Video } from "@signalwire-community/react-native";
import { useMembers, useStatus, useLayouts } from "@signalwire-community/react";
import { SafeAreaView, View, Button, Text, ScrollView } from "react-native";

export default function DemoVideo() {
  const [roomSession, setRoomSession] = useState(null);
  const { members } = useMembers(roomSession);
  const onRoomReady = useCallback((rs) => setRoomSession(rs), []);

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <Video token="Room Token" onRoomReady={onRoomReady} />

      <Text style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Members:</Text>
      {members.map((member) => (
        <Text>{member.name}</Text>
      ))}
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Each member in `members` has information about the member's current state and methods to change them.
For example, `member.remove()` would, if you have the required permissions, remove the user from the conference.

Now let's consider the following piece of code:

<Tabs groupId="react-vs-RN">
  <TabItem value="React" label="React" default>

```jsx
<b>Members: </b>
<ul>
  {members.map((member) => (
    <li>
      {member.name}
      {member.talking && "🗣"}

      {["audio", "video", "speaker"].map((io) => (
        <button onClick={member[io].toggle}>
          {member[io].muted ? "Unmute " : "Mute "} {io}
        </button>
      ))}
      <button onClick={member.remove}>Remove</button>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-600"
    src={require("./react/example1.webP").default}
    style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
    alt="A screenshot of the members list UI. Each member is listed in a bullet point, and inline buttons allow for muting or unmuting audio, video, and speaker, and removing the member, on an individual basis."
  />
  <figcaption>
    Resulting UI: a list of members, each of which has a speaking indicator and control
    buttons.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ReactNative" label="React Native" default>

```jsx
<Text style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Members:</Text>;
{
  members.map((member) => (
    <View>
      <Text>{member.name}</Text>
      <Text>{member.talking && "🗣"}</Text>

      <View style={{ flexDirection: "row", justifyContent: "space-between" }}>
        {["audio", "video", "speaker"].map((io) => (
          <Button
            onPress={member?.[io].toggle}
            title={`${member?.[io].muted ? "Unmute " : "Mute "} ${io}`}
          />
        ))}
      </View>
    </View>
  ));
}
```

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-600"
    src={require("./reactnative/member.webP").default}
    style={{ maxWidth: 400 }}
    alt="A screenshot of the members list UI. Each member is listed in a bullet point, and inline buttons allow for muting or unmuting audio, video, and speaker, and removing the member, on an individual basis."
  />
  <figcaption>
    Resulting UI: a list of members, each of which has a speaking indicator and control
    buttons.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

There are a few things to note:

1. The 🗣 emoji, conditioned on the `member.talking` property, only renders when that member is talking.
2. Similarly, `{member[io].muted ? "Unmute" : "Mute"}` will automatically update to reflect current state of the member.
3. `member.audio`, `member.video`, and `member.speaker` all provide identical interfaces to control the inputs and outputs to the stream.
   For example, `member.audio.muted` tells you if that member has their audio turned off.
   `member.audio.mute()` / `member.audio.unmute()` will turn the microphone on and off. And a simple helper method
   `member.audio.toggle()` will toggle between the states.

### Providing Controls for the Current Member

Unless you were a moderator, you wouldn't need access to controls for other members, but you would still need to control your own stream.
For that purpose, `useMembers` gives you another property: `self`, which always references the current user within the `members` array.

We could use it like so:

<Tabs groupId="react-vs-RN">
  <TabItem value="React" label="React" default>

```jsx
const { self } = useMembers(roomSession);

return (
  <>
    {/* ... */}
    {["audio", "video", "speaker"].map((io) => (
      <button onClick={self?.[io].toggle}>
        {self?.[io].muted ? "Unmute " : "Mute "} {io}
      </button>
    ))}
    <button onClick={self?.remove}>Leave</button>
  </>
);
```

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-600"
    src={require("./react/example2.webP").default}
    style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
    alt="A screenshot of the control buttons used for the user to mute or unmute audio, video, and speaker."
  />
  <figcaption>Resulting UI: a set of control buttons for the user themselves.</figcaption>
</figure>
</TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ReactNative" label="React Native" default>

```jsx
const { self } = useMembers(roomSession);

return (
  <>
    {/* ... */}
    <View style={{ flexDirection: "row", justifyContent: "space-between" }}>
      {["audio", "video", "speaker"].map((io) => (
        <Button
          onPress={self?.[io].toggle}
          title={`${self?.[io].muted ? "Unmute " : "Mute "} ${io}`}
        />
      ))}
    </View>
    <View style={{ marginTop: 5 }}>
      <Button onPress={self?.remove} title="Leave" style={{ width: 30 }} />
    </View>
  </>
);
```

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-600"
    src={require("./reactnative/self.webP").default}
    style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
    alt="A screenshot of the control buttons used for the user to mute or unmute audio, video, and speaker."
  />
  <figcaption>Resulting UI: a set of control buttons for the user themselves.</figcaption>
</figure>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That was straightforward. The symbol `self` is just a reference to the current member within the room, so you use it like any other member.
But notice the small addition: self**?.**[io].toggle(). We are
[optionally chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining)
properties to control self. That is because, before you have joined the room, there is nothing for `self` to point to, so
it points to `null`. That problem was not felt for the `members` array because mapping an empty array is safe, but
addressing `null`'s properties is not.

Thus, in the code example above, until you've joined the room, the buttons will do nothing when clicked. For better UX, it might be
better to hide or disable the buttons, to clearly indicate that those buttons are not functional yet. Which brings us to the next hook: `useStatus`.

### Altering UI if Room Has Been Joined or Left Using `useStatus`

The `useStatus` hook simply returns an `active` property that is true if the room is active, and the current user is connected to it. We can use it
to solve the problem like so:

<Tabs groupId="react-vs-RN">
  <TabItem value="React" label="React" default>

```jsx
const { self } = useMembers(roomSession);
const { active } = useStatus(roomSession);

return (
  <>
    {/* ... */}
    {["audio", "video", "speaker"].map((io) => (
      <button onClick={() => self?.[io].toggle()} disabled={!active}>
        {self?.[io].muted ? "Unmute " : "Mute "} {io}
      </button>
    ))}
    <button onClick={() => self?.remove()} disabled={!active}>
      Leave
    </button>
  </>
);
```

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-600"
    src={require("./react/example3.webP").default}
    style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
    alt="A screenshot of the control buttons used for the user to mute or unmute audio, video, and speaker. Since the user has not yet joined the room, the buttons are disabled and grayed out."
  />
  <figcaption>
    Resulting UI: the control buttons are disabled before room has been joined.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ReactNative" label="React Native" default>

```jsx
const { self } = useMembers(roomSession);
const { active } = useStatus(roomSession);

return (
  <>
    {/* ... */}
    <View style={{ flexDirection: "row", justifyContent: "space-between" }}>
      {["audio", "video", "speaker"].map((io) => (
        <Button
          onPress={self?.[io].toggle}
          title={`${self?.[io].muted ? "Unmute " : "Mute "} ${io}`}
          disabled={!active}
        />
      ))}
    </View>
    <View style={{ marginTop: 5 }}>
      <Button
        onPress={self?.remove}
        title="Leave"
        style={{ width: 30 }}
        disabled={!active}
      />
    </View>
  </>
);
```

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-600"
    src={require("./reactnative/active.webP").default}
    style={{ maxWidth: 400 }}
    alt="A screenshot of the control buttons used for the user to mute or unmute audio, video, and speaker. Since the user has not yet joined the room, the buttons are disabled and grayed out."
  />
  <figcaption>
    Resulting UI: the control buttons are disabled before room has been joined.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here we simply applied the `disabled` attribute for the buttons based on `!active`, but feel
free to make more complex UI decisions based on the `useStatus` hook.

### Working with layouts using `useLayouts`

At this point, the general pattern of usage should be apparent. With the same basic idea,
we can control the layout of the video call.

<Tabs groupId="react-vs-RN">
  <TabItem value="React" label="React" >

```jsx
const { layouts, setLayout, currentLayout } = useLayouts(roomSession);
const { active } = useStatus(roomSession);

if (!active) return null;

return (
  <select
    value={currentLayout}
    onChange={(e) => {
      setLayout({ name: e.target.value });
    }}
  >
    {layouts.map((l) => (
      <option value={l} key={l}>
        {l}
      </option>
    ))}
  </select>
);
```

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-600"
    src={require("./react/example4.webP").default}
    style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
    alt="A screenshot of the layout dropdown selector, with the current layout indicated by a checkmark."
  />
  <figcaption>Resulting UI: A layout selector that shows current layout.</figcaption>
</figure>

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ReactNative" label="React Native" default>

```jsx
const { layouts, setLayout, currentLayout } = useLayouts(roomSession);
const { active } = useStatus(roomSession);

if (!active) return null;

return (
  <Picker
    selectedValue={currentLayout}
    style={{ height: 50, width: 250 }}
    onValueChange={(itemValue) => setLayout({ name: itemValue })}
  >
    {layouts.map((layout) => (
      <Picker.Item label={layout} value={layout} />
    ))}
  </Picker>
);
```

:::note
`<Picker>` is not a basic React Native component (unlike `<Select>` in HTML, which is).
You'll want to install the picker with something like `npm i @react-native-picker/picker`,
and import it into your code with `import {Picker} from "@react-native-picker/picker`.
:::

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-600"
    src={require("./reactnative/layouts.webP").default}
    style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
    alt="A screenshot of the layout selector indicating the current layout."
  />
  <figcaption>Resulting UI: A layout selector that shows current layout.</figcaption>
</figure>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this case, `layouts` contains an array of the layouts allowed in the room,
`currentLayout` always updates to the layout applied on the room, no matter who applies it,
and `setLayout` allows you to change it.

### Enabling Screen Sharing with `useScreenShare`

<Tabs groupId="react-vs-RN">
  <TabItem value="React" label="React" default>

Screen Sharing is equally simple in React.

```jsx
const { active } = useStatus(roomSession);
const { toggle, active: screenShareActive } = useScreenShare(roomSession);

return (
  <button disabled={!active} onClick={toggle}>
    {screenShareActive ? "Stop screen share" : "Start screen share"}
  </button>
);
```

Here we are renaming the `active` property from `useScreenShare` to `screenShareActive`
so it doesn't collide with the other `active` property from `useStatus`. Now `screenShareActive`
is true when the user is sharing their screen.

<figure>
  <video className="img-600" autoPlay muted style={{ maxWidth: 600 }} loop>
    <source src={require("./react/example5.webm").default} type="video/webm" />
  </video>
  <figcaption>Resulting UI: A screen sharing button.</figcaption>
</figure>

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ReactNative" label="React Native" default>

:::info Not Available on React Native

Screen Sharing on React Native, specially on Expo, tends to be quite a bit involved, requiring at
least some tinkering with the native code, and will be the subject of a separate article.
