# First steps with fax

Learn how to send and receive your first fax using SignalWire.
You'll configure a phone number, create SWML or cXML scripts to handle faxes, and use SWML or our APIs to send faxes programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A [SignalWire account](https://signalwire.com/signup)
- At least one phone number capable of receiving faxes
- Your [API credentials](https://my.signalwire.com/credentials) (Space URL, Project ID, and API token)

## Receiving your first fax

To receive faxes, you'll configure a phone number to handle incoming faxes using either a SWML or cXML script that defines what happens when a fax arrives.

<Steps>

### Obtain a phone number

First, you need a SignalWire phone number capable of receiving faxes.

[Log in](https://signalwire.com/signin) to your SignalWire Space.
If you don't have a number yet, navigate to the Phone Numbers section and [buy a new phone number](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number).

### Create a script

<Tabs groupId="fax-script-type">
<TabItem value="swml" label="SWML">

From your [SignalWire Dashboard](https://my.signalwire.com/dashboard), create a new Resource by navigating to the resources tab, then select the "New Script" option and choose "New SWML application".

<Frame caption="Navigating to and creating a new SWML resource for handling faxes.">
  ![The new resource dialog showing cXML script
  creation.](@image/dashboard/resources/swml-resource-vid.webp)
</Frame>

Paste the following code into your script:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - receive_fax: {}
```

Save the script. It should now be located in your **Resources** tab on the left sidebar, under **Scripts**.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Legacy dashboard instructions" description="Follow these steps if your SignalWire Space is on the Legacy Dashboard">

Follow the above guide with these changes:

#### Create a SWML Script

Navigate to the "Relay/SWML" section of your Dashboard and create a new SWML Script.

#### Assign a phone number

Open the settings for your phone number. Under "Voice and Fax Settings":

- Set "Accept Incoming Calls As" to "Fax"
- Set "Handle Faxes Using" to "SWML Script"
- Select your SWML Script from the dropdown for "When a Fax Comes In"

</Accordion>

<UiAccordion />

</AccordionGroup>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cxml" label="cXML">

From your [SignalWire Dashboard](https://my.signalwire.com/dashboard), create a new Resource by selecting the Script option, then choose "cXML script".

<Frame caption="Creating a new cXML script resource for handling faxes.">
  ![The new resource dialog showing cXML script
  creation.](@image/dashboard/resources/new-cxml-bin.png)
</Frame>

In the pane that appears, select the "Script Will Be Used For" dropdown, then select Faxing.

<Frame caption="cXML script configuration with Faxing selected.">
  ![The cXML script editor showing the faxing configuration option
  selected.](@image/dashboard/resources/fax-cxml-script-example.webp)
</Frame>

Paste the following XML into your script:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
<Receive></Receive>
</Response>
```

Save the script; it should now be located in your Resources tab on the left sidebar under Scripts.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Legacy dashboard instructions" description="Follow these steps if your SignalWire Space is on the Legacy Dashboard">

Follow the above guide with these changes:

#### Create a cXML Script

Navigate to the "LaML/cXML" section of your Dashboard and create a new cXML bin.

#### Assign a phone number

Open the settings for your phone number. Under "Voice and Fax Settings":

- Set "Accept Incoming Calls As" to "Fax"
- Set "Handle Faxes Using" to "LaML Webhooks"
- Select your cXML script from the dropdown for "When a Fax Comes In"

</Accordion>

<UiAccordion />

</AccordionGroup>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configure phone number

Navigate to the "Phone Numbers" tab on the left sidebar.
From this tab, click on your newly purchased phone number, then on the "edit settings" option.
In the settings page that appears, select "Assign Resource" for "Inbound Call Settings".

<Frame caption="Assign the script to your phone number's inbound call settings.">
  ![Phone number settings page showing the Assign Resource button for inbound
  calls.](@image/dashboard/phone-numbers/assign-resource-full.png)
</Frame>

<Tabs groupId="fax-script-type">
<TabItem value="swml" label="SWML">

Select the newly created SWML script, then click "Save" to apply the configuration.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cxml" label="cXML">

Select the newly created cXML script, then click "Save" to apply the configuration.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Test your setup

Send a test fax to your configured phone number and then open the respective call log found in the "logs" section on your left sidebar.

Copy the link found in the "document" parameter and paste it into your browser to view your fax.

</Steps>

:::info Alternative: Using webhooks or SDKs

If you prefer to host the fax handling logic yourself, you have two options:

- **For SWML**: Configure a webhook endpoint that returns SWML. See our [SWML receive_fax documentation](/swml/methods/receive_fax) for more details.
- **For cXML**: Use our Compatibility SDKs. See our [`<Receive>` verb documentation](/compatibility-api/cxml/fax/receive#receive-a-fax) for code examples.

You'll need to make your code accessible to SignalWire through a webhook.
We have a [guide on testing webhooks with ngrok](/platform/basics/guides/technical-troubleshooting/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok) to help you get started.

## Sending your first fax

<Tabs groupId="send-fax-method">
<TabItem value="swml" label="SWML">

SWML can be used to send a fax through the `send_fax` method.
The below example script sends a fax, then posts the result to a predetermined webhook.

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - send_fax:
        document: https://example.com/fax_to_send.pdf
    - execute:
        dest: 'https://example.com/handle_outgoing_fax_result'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="signalwire-rest" label="SignalWire REST API">

You can also utilize SWML to send faxes via a POST request to the SignalWire REST API [Create a Call endpoint](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/calling/calls-create). 

This can be done either by referencing a SWML script via webhook URL or by including the SWML inline in the request body.


<Tabs groupId="rest-api-method">
<TabItem value="url" label="Webhook URL">

```bash
  curl -L -g 'https://{Your_Space_Name}.signalwire.com/api/calling/calls' \
  -u '{YourProjectID}:{YourAPIToken}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \

    }
  }'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="compatibility" label="Compatibility">

Send a fax by making a POST request to the Compatibility API [Send Fax endpoint](/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints/send-fax):

```bash
  curl -L -g 'https://{YOUR_SPACE_URL}.signalwire.com/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/{YourProjectID}/Faxes' \
  -u '{YourProjectID}:{YourAPIToken}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -d 'MediaUrl=https://example.com/fax_to_send.pdf' \
  -d 'To=+1xxxxxxxxxx' \
  -d 'From=+1xxxxxxxxxx'
```

You can also send faxes using our [Compatibility SDK's Send a Fax function](/compatibility-api/client-sdks/methods/faxes/send):

<TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
const { RestClient } = require("@signalwire/compatibility-api");
