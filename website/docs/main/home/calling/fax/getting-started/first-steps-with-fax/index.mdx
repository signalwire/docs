# First steps with fax

Learn how to send and receive your first fax using SignalWire.
You'll configure a phone number, create cXML or SWML scripts to handle faxes, and use our APIs to send faxes programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A [SignalWire account](https://signalwire.com/signup)
- At least one phone number capable of receiving faxes
- Your API credentials (Space URL, Project ID, and API token)

## Receiving your first fax

To receive faxes, you'll configure a phone number to handle incoming faxes using either a cXML or SWML script that defines what happens when a fax arrives.

      end

      subgraph Script["Script Response"]
        C["cXML: &lt;Receive/&gt;<br>or<br>SWML: receive_fax"]
      end

      C -- "(3) Script processes and stores the fax in your SignalWire Dashboard" --> N1

### Set up your fax handler with SWML

<Steps>

#### Obtain a phone number

First, you need a SignalWire phone number capable of receiving faxes.

[Log in](https://signalwire.com/signin) to your SignalWire Space.
If you don't have a number yet, navigate to the Phone Numbers section and [buy a new phone number](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number).

#### Create a SWML script

From your [SignalWire Dashboard](https://my.signalwire.com/dashboard), create a new Resource by navigating to the resources tab, then select the "New Script" option and choose "New SWML application".

<Frame caption="Navigating to and creating a new SWML resource for handling faxes.">
  ![The new resource dialog showing cXML script
  creation.](@image/dashboard/resources/swml-resource-vid.webp)
</Frame>

Paste the following code into your script:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - receive_fax: {}
```

Save the script; it should now be located in your Resources tab on the left sidebar under Scripts.

#### Configure phone number for SWML

Navigate to the "Phone Numbers" tab on the left sidebar.
From this tab, click on your newly purchased phone number, then on the "edit settings" option.
In the settings page that appears, select "Assign Resource" for "Inbound Call Settings".

  ![Phone number settings page showing the Assign Resource button for inbound
  calls.](@image/dashboard/phone-numbers/assign-resource-full.png)
</Frame>

Select the newly created SWML script, then click "Save" to apply the configuration.

#### Test your setup

Send a test fax to your configured phone number.
Once received, it can be viewed in your dashboard under the logs sidebar option.
These will be located in their own, specific "fax" logs tab:

### Set up your fax handler with cXML

<Steps>

#### Obtain a phone number

First, you need a SignalWire phone number capable of receiving faxes.

[Log in](https://signalwire.com/signin) to your SignalWire Space.
If you don't have a number yet, navigate to the Phone Numbers section and [buy a new phone number](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number).

#### Create a cXML script

From your [SignalWire Dashboard](https://my.signalwire.com/dashboard), create a new Resource by selecting the Script option, then choose "cXML script".

<Frame caption="Creating a new cXML script resource for handling faxes.">
  ![The new resource dialog showing cXML script
  creation.](@image/dashboard/resources/new-cxml-bin.png)
</Frame>

In the pane that appears, select the "Script Will Be Used For" dropdown, then select Faxing.

<Frame caption="cXML script configuration with Faxing selected.">
  ![The cXML script editor showing the faxing configuration option

</Frame>

Paste the following XML into your script:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
<Receive></Receive>
</Response>
```

Save the script; it should now be located in your Resources tab on the left sidebar under Scripts.

#### Configure phone number for cXML

Navigate to the "Phone Numbers" tab on the left sidebar.
From this tab, click on your newly purchased phone number, then on the "edit settings" option.
In the settings page that appears, select "Assign Resource" for "Inbound Call Settings".

</Steps>

### Alternative: Using Compatibility SDKs or webhooks

If you prefer to host the fax handling logic yourself, you have two options:

- **For cXML**: Use our Compatibility SDKs. See our [`<Receive>` verb documentation](/compatibility-api/cxml/fax/receive#receive-a-fax) for code examples.
- **For SWML**: Configure a webhook endpoint that returns SWML. See our [SWML receive_fax documentation](/swml/methods/receive_fax) for more details.

You'll need to make your code accessible to SignalWire through a webhook.
We have a [guide on testing webhooks with ngrok](/platform/basics/guides/technical-troubleshooting/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok) to help you get started.

## Sending your first fax

A fax can be sent by utilizing either the SignalWire REST API or the Compatibility SDK.

### Using the REST API

Send a fax by making a POST request to the [Send Fax endpoint](/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints/send-fax):

```bash
POST https://<YOUR_SPACE_URL>.signalwire.com/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/Faxes
```

Required parameters:

- `From` - Your SignalWire phone number
- `To` - The destination fax number
- `MediaUrl` - URL to the document you want to send

### Using the Compatibility SDK

You can also send faxes using our [Compatibility SDK's Send a Fax function](/compatibility-api/client-sdks/methods/faxes/send):

  .create({
    from: "+13103383454",
    to: "+13104456789",
