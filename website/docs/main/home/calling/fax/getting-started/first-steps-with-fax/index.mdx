# First steps with fax

This guide will walk you through sending and receiving your first fax using SignalWire. You'll learn how to configure a phone number, create cXML scripts to handle faxes, and use our APIs to send faxes programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
- A [SignalWire account](https://signalwire.com/signup)
- At least one phone number capable of receiving faxes
- Your API credentials (Space URL, Project ID, and API token)


## Receiving your first fax

To receive faxes, you'll configure a phone number to handle incoming faxes using a cXML script that defines what happens when a fax arrives.

      end

      subgraph XML["cXML Response"]
        C["&lt;?xml&gt;<br>&lt;Response&gt;<br>&lt;Receive action='/fax/received'/&gt;<br>&lt;/Response&gt;"]
      end

      C -- "(3) The Receive verb processes and stores the fax in your SignalWire Dashboard" --> N1
  ```

<Steps>

### Obtain a phone number

First, you need a SignalWire phone number capable of receiving faxes.

[Log in](https://signalwire.com/signin) to your SignalWire Space. If you don't have a number yet, navigate to the Phone Numbers section and [buy a new phone number](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number).


### Create a cXML script

From your [SignalWire Dashboard](https://my.signalwire.com/dashboard), create a new Resource by selecting the Script option, then choose "cXML script".

<Frame caption="Creating a new cXML script resource for handling faxes.">
    ![The new resource dialog showing cXML script creation.](@image/dashboard/resources/new-cxml-bin.png)
</Frame>

In the pane that appears, select the "Script Will Be Used For" dropdown, then select Faxing.

<Frame caption="cXML script configuration with Faxing selected.">
    ![The cXML script editor showing the faxing configuration option selected.](@image/dashboard/resources/fax-cxml-script-example.webp)
</Frame>

Paste the following XML into your script:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Receive action="/fax/received"/>
</Response>
```

Save the script, it should now be located in your Resources tab on the left sidebar under Scripts.

### Configure phone number to handle faxes

Navigate to the "Phone Numbers" tab on the left sidebar. From this tab, click on your newly purchased phone number, then on the "edit settings" option. In the settings page, select "Assign Resource" for the "Inbound Message Settings" option on the page.

    ![Phone number settings page showing the Assign Resource button for inbound messages.](@image/dashboard/phone-numbers/assign-resource-full.png)
</Frame>

Select the newly created cXML script, then click "Save" to apply the configuration.

### Test your setup

Send a test fax to your configured phone number. Once received, it can be viewed in your dashboard under the logs sidebar option. These will be located in their own, specific "fax" logs tab:

</Frame>

</Steps>

### Alternative: Using Compatibility SDKs

If you prefer to host the fax handling logic yourself, you can use our SDKs instead of cXML scripts. See our [`<Receive>` verb documentation](/compatibility-api/cxml/fax/receive#receive-a-fax) for code examples.

You'll need to make your code accessible to SignalWire through a webhook. We have a [guide on testing webhooks with ngrok](/platform/basics/guides/technical-troubleshooting/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok) to help you get started.

## Sending your first fax

A fax can be sent by utilizing either the SignalWire REST API or the Compatability SDK

### Using the REST API

Send a fax by making a POST request to the [Send Fax endpoint](/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints/send-fax):

```bash
POST https://<YOUR_SPACE_URL>.signalwire.com/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/Faxes
```

Required parameters:
- `From` - Your SignalWire phone number
- `To` - The destination fax number
- `MediaUrl` - URL to the document you want to send

### Using the Compatibility SDK

You can also send faxes using our [Compatibility SDK's Send a Fax function](/compatibility-api/client-sdks/methods/faxes/send):
