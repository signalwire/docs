Python
------

For the following code to work, you will need to have pandas, DateTime, and the SignalWire Python SDK installed. 

Read about the different ways to install pandas [Here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)

Read about DateTime and how to install using pip [Here](https://pypi.org/project/DateTime/)

Read about the SignalWire Python SDK and how to install it [Here](/compatibility-api/sdks)

First, we need to import the necessary resources.  
In this example, that is DateTime, pandas, and the SignalWire Client. We also need to instantiate the SignalWire client using the project ID, auth token, and Space URL. 

```python
from datetime import datetime
from signalwire.rest import Client as signalwire_client
import pandas as pd

client = signalwire_client("ProjectID", "AuthToken", signalwire_space_url = 'SpaceURL')
```

Next, we need to choose what parameters we'd like to filter by.

In this example, I have included how to filter by a date range, To number, and From number. `date_created_after` and `date_created_on_or_before` are both DateTime objects where the order for the arguments is Year, Month, Date, Hour, Minute, Seconds. You can leave hour, minute, and seconds at 0, unless you have a specific time of day you would like to filter by. 

For months Jan - September, A slight change was made because the python version (3.9) does not support leading 0's in DateTime anymore. You must use the 0o prefix for octal literals now. That is reflected below in the code. If your version doesn’t include that limitation, you can switch it back to 01 or whatever month you need. 

```python

faxes = client.fax.faxes.list(
    to='+18551111111',
    from_='+12251111111',
    date_created_after=datetime(2021, 0o3, 0o1, 17, 0o7, 0),
    date_created_on_or_before=datetime(2021, 0o4, 1, 0, 0, 0),

)

```

We now need to insert the data from faxes into an array. Here we set up an empty array. This will contain all of the data that we will gather from the faxes. We can loop through messages and append each of the following parameters to our empty array: `date_created`, `status`, and `sid`. 

You can expand this to include as many or as few parameters as you'd like. To see all of the parameters returned in the JSON response, you can view our API documentation here: [List Faxes API](/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints/list-all-faxes)

After that, we print the array so that we can see what we have inserted for debugging purposes. 

```python
d = []

# Appends all data from faxes into an array
for record in faxes:
    d.append((record.from_, record.to, record.date_created, record.status, record.sid))

print(d)

```

Next, we create a data frame and export it to CSV.  
The next section of this code is to create a data frame using pandas with column name headers. It's important to make sure that the order of the headers matches the order of the parameters you inserted into the array above. If you choose to add more or remove parameters, make sure to double-check that the order matches, or your data will be mismatched in the CSV. 

We then print the data frame for debugging purposes and export the data frame to CSV. Using the parameter index=False turns off the indexing for each row. You can rename faxes.csv to be as specific or general as you'd like. 

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(d, columns=('From', 'To', 'Date', 'Status', 'FaxSID'))

print('dataframe')
print('\n')
print(df)

df.to_csv('faxes.csv', index=False, encoding='utf-8')
```

PHP
---

For the following code to work, you will need to have the SignalWire PHP SDK installed. 

Read about the SignalWire PHP SDK and how to install it [Here](/compatibility-api/sdks)

You will also need to make sure that the vendor/autoload.php path points to the correct location on your computer, as we can’t determine that for you. However, if you want to run this script exactly, install the SDK from within the folder that contains this PHP script.

First, we need to import the necessary resources.  
In this example, that just means we need to point to the correct path of the vendor autoload file on your computer. We also need to instantiate the SignalWire client using the project ID, auth token, and Space URL. 

```PHP
<?php

require './vendor/autoload.php';
use SignalWire\Rest\Client;
$client = new Client('ProjectID', 'Auth Token', array("signalwireSpaceUrl" => "YOURSPACE.signalwire.com"));

```

Next, we need to choose what parameters we'd like to filter by.  
In this example, I have included how to filter by a date range, from number, and to number.

```PHP
$faxes = $client->fax->faxes->read([
    "dateCreatedAfter" => "2021-03-01",
    'From' => '+12251111111', // filter by From
    'To' => '+18551111111', // filter by To
]);
```

In the next section, we need to create the file to insert the fax data into.  
Begin by writing headers and storing them in a variable called `$fields`. We also use `implode` to join the elements of the array with a string. We will then use `fopen` to create and open a file named **TodaysDate_FaxReport**. After that, we use `fputcsv` to insert our headers stored in `$fields` into our file. 

```PHP
$fields = array('Fax SID', 'From', 'To', 'Create Date', 'Status', 'Direction', 'Price');
echo '"'.implode('","', $fields).'"'."\n";

$fp = fopen(date("Y-m-d").'_FaxReport.csv', 'w');

fputcsv($fp, $fields);
```

Next, we need to loop through our `$faxes` array in order to gather the necessary fax data and insert it into our CSV. It is important to make sure the order of the headers is the same as the order of the values we will be gathering. As we loop through each fax record, we will insert it into the CSV one by one and use implode to join the elements of the array with a string. The last step is to close the file! 

```PHP
foreach ($faxes as $fax) {
    $row = array(
        $fax->sid, $fax->from, $fax->to, $fax->dateCreated->format('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
        $fax->status, $fax->direction, $fax->price,
    );
   
    fputcsv($fp, $row);

    echo '"'.implode('","', $row).'"'."\n";
}

fclose($fp);
```

Ruby
----

For the following code to work, you will need to have Active Support, CSV, and the SignalWire Ruby SDK installed. 

Read about the SignalWire Ruby SDK and how to install it [Here](/compatibility-api/sdks)

Read about Active Support and how to install [Here](https://rubygems.org/gems/activesupport/versions/5.0.0.1)

Read about CSV and how to install [Here](https://rubygems.org/gems/csv/versions/0.0.1)

First, we need to import the necessary resources.  
In this case, we need to import `signalwire/sdk`, `active_support/time`, and `csv`.  

We also need to instantiate the SignalWire client using the project ID, auth token, and Space URL. 

```Ruby
require 'signalwire/sdk'
require 'active_support/time'
require 'csv'

@client = Signalwire::REST::Client.new 'ProjectID', 'Auth Token', signalwire_space_url: 'YOURSPACE.signalwire.com'
```

Next, we need to choose what parameters we'd like to filter by.  
In this example, I have included how to filter by a date range, to number, from number, and the page size of the results returned. 

```Ruby
faxes = @client.fax.faxes.list(page_size: 100, to:'+18551111111', from:'+12251111111', date_created_after: (DateTime.now - 7.days).strftime('%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT'))
```

Next, we need to create headers for our CSV and insert the headers/fax records into the CSV. It's important to make sure that the headers are in the exact same order as the message record parameters. 

In the code section below, we create an array of headers. Next, we open a file Faxes.csv. We insert the headers before we begin the loop, otherwise, the headers will precede every single record. After the headers have been inserted, we loop through each of the fax records in `faxes` and insert them one by one with all the listed parameters into the CSV. 

```Ruby
headers = ['FaxSID','Date Created', 'From', 'To', 'Status']

faxes.each do |record|
      
        CSV.open('Faxes.csv', 'w+') do |csv|
              
                csv << headers
                faxes.each do |record|
                puts record.sid
                csv << [record.sid, record.date_created, record.from,record.to, record.status]
        end
end
end 
```

Node.js
-------

For the following code to work, you will need to have the SignalWire NodeJS SDK installed. 

Read about the SignalWire NodeJS SDK and how to install it [Here](/compatibility-api/sdks)

First, we need to import the necessary resources.  
In this case, we need to import `@signalwire/compatibility-api` and `fs`.

We also need to instantiate the SignalWire client using the project ID, auth token, and Space URL. 

```Javascript
import { RestClient } from "@signalwire/compatibility-api";
import fs from "fs";

const client = RestClient(
  "ProjectID",
  "Auth Token",
  { signalwireSpaceUrl: "YOURSPACE.signalwire.com" }
);
```

Next, we need to create our CSV file, an empty array to put our records into, and an array of headers. It's important to make sure that later when we loop through the fax records, we push the parameters into the CSV in the same order as the headers here. Lastly, we push the headers into the CSV as the first row. 

```Javascript
let writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("Faxes.csv");
let newLine = [];

const header = [
  "Fax Sid",
  "To",
  "From",
  "Date Created",
  "Status",
  "Price",
];

newLine.push(header);
```

Next, we determine which parameters we'd like to filter by and what parameters we expect to be pushed into the CSV. The filters used in this example are the To and From numbers.  As we loop through `faxes`, we push each parameter into the CSV one by one. After we are finished looping through `faxes` We use `writeStream.write` to separate these values by commas and add a new line at the end. Lastly, we use `writeStream.end` to close the file. 

```Javascript
client.fax.faxes
  .list({
    to:'+18551111111', 
    from:'+12251111111,
  })
  .then((faxes) => {
    faxes.forEach((c) => {
      newLine.push(
        c.sid,
        c.to,
        c.from,
        c.dateCreated,
        c.status,
        c.price
      );
    });
    writeStream.write(newLine.join(",") + "\n", () => {});
    writeStream.end();
  });
```

Conclusion
----------

Record keeping is important, so we hope these examples help make it easier to filter your faxes and export them to an external CSV with ease. All of these examples will accomplish the same goal and can be built upon to expand or further drill down the amount of data returned.
