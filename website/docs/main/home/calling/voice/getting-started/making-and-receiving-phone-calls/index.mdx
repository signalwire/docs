# Making and Receiving Phone Calls

In this guide we are going to show how to make and receive phone calls using the following products:

- **SWML**
  - SWML Script
- **Compatibility API**
  - REST APIs
  - cXML Bins

## Prerequisites

To be able to make calls, you will need:

- a SignalWire phone number
- your API credentials (Space URL, Project ID, and API token)

Also, note that if your account is in [trial mode](/platform/dashboard/billing#trial-mode), 
you'll need to upgrade it in order to call numbers other than your own verified numbers. 
See [How to exit Trial Mode](/platform/dashboard/billing#trial-mode).

To acquire a phone number, [Log in](https://signalwire.com/signin) to your SignalWire Space. From the [Phone Numbers section](https://my.signalwire.com/?phone_numbers), you can [buy a new phone number](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number). You will need at least one number to make and receive calls.

For what concerns your API credentials, find these in the API section of your Space, as shown in the following figure. You may need to create a new token if you never used one. Make sure that your token has the "Voice" scope enabled.

## SWML

### Receiving incoming calls

To handle incoming calls we need to configure the phone number in our
[SignalWire Space](https://signalwire.com/signin) to answer calls using a SWML Script.

<CreateSWML />

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - play: say:Hello from SignalWire!
```

Take note of the Request URL for the SWML Script that we created. You can even create a new script if you want to define a different behavior for incoming calls.

To configure your number to handle incoming calls with an SWML Script, click the ["Phone Numbers" section](https://my.signalwire.com/?phone_numbers) within your SignalWire Space, and edit the settings of the specific number you would like to use to answer calls. Set "Handle calls using" to "a SWML Script", then select your SWML Script from the dropdown:

That's it! Inbound calls to this SignalWire number will execute the specified SWML Script.

### Making your first call

Outbound calls can be made via The SignalWire REST API's [Create a Call endpoint](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/calling/calls-create).
This is accomplished by sending a POST request with SWML in the body to handle the call. 
The SWML can be served via URL or passed inline directly.

## Compatibility API

### Receiving incoming calls

<Tabs groupId="newVlegacyUI">

<TabItem value="newui" label="New Dashboard">
    To handle incoming calls we need to configure the phone number in our
    [SignalWire Space](https://signalwire.com/signin) to answer calls using a cXML
    resource.
    
    If you're on the **new UI**, go to the "Resources" section from the sidebar, and create a new Resource.
    In the new resource picker, select "Script" and create a "cXML script".

    <Frame>
    ![Attach Phone Number](@image/dashboard/resources/new-cxml-bin.png)
    </Frame>

    Utilize the following cXML which uses the [&lt;Say>](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/say)
    verb to play a text-to-speech message:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
      <Say>Welcome to SignalWire. This is my first call.</Say>
    </Response>
    ```

    Go to the "Phone Numbers" section from the sidebar, and
    edit the phone number you want to answer calls with. From there, click on the
    "Assign Resource" button for incoming calls, and select the newly created cXML script to connect.

    <Frame>
    ![Attach Resource](@image/dashboard/phone-numbers/assign-resource-voice.png)
    </Frame>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="legacyui" label="Legacy Dashboard">

    To handle incoming calls we need to configure the phone number in our
    [SignalWire Space](https://signalwire.com/signin) to answer calls using a SWML or cXML script.

    Utilize the following cXML which uses the [&lt;Say>](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/say)
    verb to play a text-to-speech message:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
      <Say>Welcome to SignalWire. This is my first call.</Say>
    </Response>
    ```
    Click the "Phone Numbers" section from your sidebar, and select the specific number you would like to use to answer calls. The same number we used before can work.

    Make sure that "_Accept Calls As_" is set to "_Voice Calls_", "_Handle Calls Using_" is set to "_LaML Webhooks_" or "_SWML Scripts_",
    and paste your Bin URL in as the value for "_When a Call Comes In_". Click "_Save_", and you're done!
    Inbound calls to this SignalWire number will execute the specified bin.

    <Frame>
    ![Attach Phone Number](@image/dashboard/legacy/attach-phone-number-vid.webp)
    </Frame>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Making your first call

To call a number via cXML you can make a POST request to the Compatibility REST API's [Create a Call](/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints/create-a-call) endpoint.

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://{SpaceName}.signalwire.com/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/{ProjectID}/Calls' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -u '{ProjectID}:{APIToken}' \
  --data-urlencode 'Url=https://{BinRequestURL}' \
  --data-urlencode 'From={+XXXXXXXXXX}' \
  --data-urlencode 'To={+YYYYYYYYYY}'
```

Make sure to replace all occurrences of `{SpaceName}`, `{ProjectID}`,
`{APIToken}`, `{BinRequestURL}`, `{+XXXXXXXXXX}`, and `{+YYYYYYYYYY}` with
your actual values.

In order to locate the `{BinRequestURL}`, navigate to your cXML script and copy the Request URL that is present.


:::note

Instead of your own bin, feel free to try one of ours: `<https://<spacename>.signalwire.com/laml-bins/f85376be-7fe1-439b-a24f-3113ff980804>`.

:::

Congratulations! Once the cURL request is executed, your personal phone number
(`{+YYYYYYYYYY}`) will start ringing.



# Wrapping up

cXML bins allow you to program the behavior of phone calls, and REST APIs make it
easy to trigger calls to any phone number. Find the documentation for our
Compatibility API (XML and REST) [here](/compatibility-api/cxml).

As we have seen, REST APIs are easy to get started with. In case you need more
flexibility and real-time control on your calls, you may be interested in our
guide about how to [make and receive calls in Node.js](/sdks/realtime-sdk/guides/voice/first-steps-with-voice).
