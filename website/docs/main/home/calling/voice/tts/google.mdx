# Google Cloud

Google Cloud offers a number of robust text-to-speech
[voice models](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types).
SignalWire supports all Google Cloud voices in both General Availability and Preview 
[launch stages](https://cloud.google.com/products?hl=en#product-launch-stages),
except for the Studio model.

## Models {#models}

Google Cloud offers multiple TTS model types with varying quality and pricing:

| Model Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Standard` | Basic, budget-friendly TTS model |
| `WaveNet` | Deep learning-based, natural and lifelike speech |
| `Neural2` | Advanced model with human-like pronunciation |
| `Polyglot` | Multi-language variants of specific voices |

The model type is encoded in the voice name (e.g., `en-US-Neural2-A`, `es-ES-Wavenet-B`).

- [Standard](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types#standard_voices)
is a basic, reliable, and budget-friendly text-to-speech model.
The Standard model is less natural-sounding than WaveNet and Neural2, but more cost-effective.
- [WaveNet](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types#wavenet_voices)
is powered by deep learning technology and offers more natural and lifelike speech output.
- [Neural2](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types#neural2_voices)
is based on the same technology used to create Custom Voices
and prioritizes natural and human-like pronunciation and intonation.
- [Polyglot](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/polyglot?hl=en#overview)
voices have variants in multiple languages. For example, at time of writing,
the `polyglot-1` voice has variants for English (Australia), English (US), French, German, Spanish (Spain), and Spanish (US).

## Billing {#billing}

Google Cloud TTS usage on SignalWire is billed according to the following SKU codes:

| Billing SKU | Models | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `gcloud` | Standard, WaveNet | Traditional and WaveNet model billing |
| `gcloud_cog` | Neural2, Polyglot | Cognitive services (Neural2) model billing |

The billing SKU is automatically determined by the voice model type. Neural2 and Polyglot voices use the `gcloud_cog` SKU, while Standard and WaveNet voices use the `gcloud` SKU.

Consult the [Voice API Pricing](https://signalwire.com/pricing/voice) page for current rates.

## Usage {#usage}

Copy the voice ID in whole from the **Voice name** column of Google's table of
[supported voices](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices).
Google Cloud voice IDs encode language and model information,
so no modification is needed to make these selections.
Prepend `gcloud.` and the string is ready for use.
For example: `gcloud.en-GB-Wavenet-A`

Google Cloud voice IDs conform to the following format:

```
gcloud.<voice>
```

Where `<voice>` is the complete voice name from Google's [supported voices table](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices).

**Voice name pattern:**

Google Cloud voice names follow: `<language>-<model>-<variant>`

- `language`: Language code (e.g., `en-US`, `es-ES`, `ja-JP`)
- `model`: Model type (e.g., `Standard`, `Wavenet`, `Neural2`, `Polyglot`)
- `variant`: Voice variant letter (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`)

**Examples:**
```
gcloud.en-US-Neural2-A
gcloud.en-GB-Wavenet-B
gcloud.es-ES-Neural2-A
gcloud.ja-JP-Neural2-B
gcloud.fr-FR-Wavenet-C
gcloud.de-DE-Standard-A
gcloud.en-US-Polyglot-1
```

**Case insensitivity:**

Voice IDs are case-insensitive. These are equivalent:
```
gcloud.en-US-Neural2-A
gcloud.en-us-neural2-a
```

**Note:** Google Cloud voice IDs already encode language and model information.

## Languages {#languages}

Sample all available voices with
[Google's supported voices and languages reference](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices).
Copy the voice identifier string in whole from the **Voice name** column.

Unlike the other supported engines, Google Cloud voice identifier strings include both voice and language keys,
following the pattern `<language>-<model>-<variant>`.
For example:

- English (UK) WaveNet female voice: `en-GB-Wavenet-A`
- Spanish (Spain) Neural2 male voice: `es-ES-Neural2-B`
- Mandarin Chinese Standard female voice: `cmn-CN-Standard-D`

<TabItem value="swml" label="SWML">
Use the
[**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages#use-voice-strings)
SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai).
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:
        - name: English
          code: en-US
          voice: gcloud.en-US-Neural2-A
```
Alternatively, use the [**`say_voice`** parameter](/swml/methods/play#parameters) 
of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play)
SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - set:
      say_voice: "gcloud.en-US-Neural2-A"
  - play: "say:Greetings. This is the 2-A US English voice from Google Cloud's Neural2 text-to-speech model."
