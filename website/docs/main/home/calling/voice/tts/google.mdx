# Google Cloud

Google Cloud offers a number of robust text-to-speech
[voice models](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types).
SignalWire supports all Google Cloud voices in both General Availability and Preview 
[launch stages](https://cloud.google.com/products?hl=en#product-launch-stages),
except for the Studio model.

- [Standard](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types#standard_voices)
is a basic, reliable, and budget-friendly text-to-speech model.
The Standard model is less natural-sounding than WaveNet and Neural2, but more cost-effective.
- [WaveNet](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types#wavenet_voices)
is powered by deep learning technology and offers more natural and lifelike speech output.
- [Neural2](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types#neural2_voices)
is based on the same technology used to create 
[Custom Voices](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/custom-voice/docs)
and prioritizes natural and human-like pronunciation and intonation.
- [Polyglot](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/polyglot?hl=en#overview)
voices have variants in multiple languages. For example, at time of writing,
the `polyglot-1` voice has variants for English (Australia), English (US), French, German, Spanish (Spain), and Spanish (US).

## Languages

Sample all available voices with
[Google's supported voices and languages reference](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices).
Copy the voice identifier string in whole from the **Voice name** column.

Unlike the other supported engines, Google Cloud voice identifier strings include both voice and language keys,
following the pattern `<language>-<model>-<variant>`.
For example:

- English (UK) WaveNet female voice: `en-GB-Wavenet-A`
- Spanish (Spain) Neural2 male voice: `es-ES-Neural2-B`
- Mandarin Chinese Standard female voice: `cmn-CN-Standard-D`

## Voice IDs

Copy the voice ID in whole from the **Voice name** column of Google's table of 
[supported voices](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices).
Google Cloud voice IDs encode language and model information, so no modification is needed to make these selections.
Prepend `gcloud.` and the string is ready for use.
For example: `gcloud.en-GB-Wavenet-A`

{/* Refer to the [Types of voices](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types#studio_voices) 
guide for information regarding SSML compatibility, product release status, and audio quality. */}

## Examples

Learn how to use Google Cloud voices on the SignalWire platform.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="swml" label="SWML">
Use the
[**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages#use-voice-strings)
SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai).
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:
        - name: English
          code: en-US
          voice: gcloud.en-US-Neural2-A
```
Alternatively, use the [**`say_voice`** parameter](/swml/methods/play#parameters) 
of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play)
SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - set:
      say_voice: "gcloud.en-US-Neural2-A"
  - play: "say:Greetings. This is the 2-A US English voice from Google Cloud's Neural2 text-to-speech model."
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="relay" label="RELAY Realtime SDK">
```javascript
// This example uses the Node.js SDK for SignalWire's RELAY Realtime API.
const playback = await call.playTTS({ 
    text: "Greetings. This is the 2-A US English voice from Google Cloud's Neural2 text-to-speech model.",
    voice: "gcloud.en-US-Neural2-A",

await playback.ended();
