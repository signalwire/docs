# Deepgram

Deepgram offers a range of **English-speaking** voices for its text-to-speech API, each designed to produce
natural-sounding speech output in an array of different accents and speaking styles.

Deepgram's voices are promised to have human-like tones, rhythm, and emotion, lower than 250 ms
latency, and are optimized for high-throughput applications.

Consult Deepgram's [TTS models guide](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/tts-models)
for more information and samples for supported voices.

## Models {#models}

Deepgram's Aura model provides ultra-low latency text-to-speech optimized for conversational AI:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `aura` | **Default** - Low-latency conversational TTS with human-like tones |

All Deepgram voices use the Aura model architecture, delivering sub-250ms latency.

## Voices {#voices}

Deepgram Aura voices are designed for natural-sounding English speech. Each voice follows the pattern `aura-<name>-en`.

Popular voices include:
- `aura-asteria-en` - Clear, professional female voice
- `aura-luna-en` - Warm, conversational female voice
- `aura-stella-en` - Energetic, friendly female voice
- `aura-athena-en` - Authoritative female voice
- `aura-hera-en` - Mature, confident female voice
- `aura-orion-en` - Deep, authoritative male voice
- `aura-arcas-en` - Professional male voice
- `aura-perseus-en` - Friendly male voice
- `aura-angus-en` - Casual male voice
- `aura-orpheus-en` - Smooth, articulate male voice
- `aura-helios-en` - Energetic male voice
- `aura-zeus-en` - Powerful, commanding male voice

For a complete list, consult Deepgram's [Voice Selection guide](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/tts-models).

## Usage {#usage}

Deepgram voice IDs conform to the following format:

```
deepgram.<voice>
```

Where `<voice>` is the voice identifier from Deepgram's [Voice Selection](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/tts-models) reference.

Copy the voice ID from the **Values** column of Deepgram's Voice Selection reference, prepend `deepgram.`, and the string is ready for use.

**Examples:**
```
deepgram.aura-asteria-en
deepgram.aura-orion-en
