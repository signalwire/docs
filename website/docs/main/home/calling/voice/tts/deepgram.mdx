# Deepgram

Deepgram offers a range of **English-speaking** voices for its text-to-speech API, each designed to produce
natural-sounding speech output in an array of different accents and speaking styles.

Deepgram's voices are promised to have human-like tones, rhythm, and emotion, lower than 250 ms
latency, and are optimized for high-throughput applications.

Consult Deepgram's [TTS models guide](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/tts-models) 
for more information and samples for supported voices.

## Voice IDs

Copy the voice ID from the **Values** column of Deepgram's
[Voice Selection](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/tts-models) reference.
Prepend `deepgram.` and the string is ready for use.
For example: `deepgram.aura-athena-en`

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="swml" label="SWML">
Use the
[**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages#use-voice-strings)
SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai).
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:
        - name: English
          code: en-US
          voice: deepgram.aura-asteria-en
```
Alternatively, use the [**`say_voice`** parameter](/swml/methods/play#parameters) 
of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play)
SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - set:
      say_voice: "deepgram.aura-asteria-en"
  - play: "say:Greetings. This is the Asteria voice from Deepgram's Aura text-to-speech model."
```
