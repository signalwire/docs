# OpenAI

OpenAI offers versatile multilingual voices balancing low latency and good quality.
While voices are optimized for English, they perform well across all [supported languages](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/supported-languages).

Consult [OpenAI's Text-to-Speech documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/overview)
for more information and audio samples for available voices.

## Models {#models}

OpenAI offers two TTS models with different quality and latency characteristics:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `tts-1` | **Default** - Standard quality, optimized for speed |
| `tts-1-hd` | High-definition quality, improved audio fidelity |

## Voices {#voices}

OpenAI provides 6 fully multilingual voices optimized for natural-sounding speech:

| Voice | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `alloy` | Neutral, balanced voice |
| `echo` | Warm, expressive voice |
| `fable` | British accent, articulate |
| `onyx` | Deep, authoritative voice |
| `nova` | Energetic, friendly voice |
| `shimmer` | Soft, gentle voice |

<TabItem value="swml" label="SWML">
Use the
[**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages#use-voice-strings)
SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai).
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:

of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play)
SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.
```yaml
