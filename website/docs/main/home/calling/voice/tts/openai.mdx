# OpenAI

OpenAI offers versatile multilingual voices balancing low latency and good quality.
While voices are optimized for English, they perform well across all [supported languages](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/supported-languages).

Consult [OpenAI's Text-to-Speech documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/overview)
for more information and audio samples for available voices.

## Voice IDs

Copy the voice ID from OpenAI's [Voice Options](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/voice-options) reference.

Prepend `openai.` and the string is ready for use.
For example: `openai.alloy`

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="swml" label="SWML">
Use the
[**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages#use-voice-strings)
SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai).
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:
        - name: English
          code: en-US
          voice: openai.alloy
```
Alternatively, use the [**`say_voice`** parameter](/swml/methods/play#parameters) 
of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play)
SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - set:
      say_voice: "openai.alloy"
  - play: "say:Greetings. This is the Alloy voice from OpenAI's text-to-speech model."
```
