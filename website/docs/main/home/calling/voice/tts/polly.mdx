## Models {#models}

SignalWire supports the following three Amazon models. 

<CardGroup cols="3">

  <Card title="Standard" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/standard-voices.html">
    Polly Standard is a traditional, cost-effective, and reliable TTS model.
    
    Example voice ID string: `amazon.Emma:en-GB` or `amazon.Emma:standard:en-GB`
  </Card>

  <Card title="Neural" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/neural-voices.html">
    Polly Neural produces more natural, human-like speech than Polly Standard.
    
    Example voice ID string: `amazon.Kendra:neural:en-US`
  </Card>

  <Card title="Generative" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/generative-voices.html">
    Polly Generative is Amazon's largest and most realistic model.

## Billing {#billing}

Amazon Polly usage on SignalWire is billed according to the following SKU codes:

| Billing SKU | Model(s) | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `amazon_tts_standard` | Standard | Traditional concatenative TTS, most cost-effective |
| `amazon_tts_neural` | Neural | Advanced neural TTS with natural-sounding speech |
| `amazon_tts_generative` | Generative | Latest generative AI model with highest quality |

The model you specify determines which billing SKU is applied. Standard is the default if no model is specified.

Consult the [Voice API Pricing](https://signalwire.com/pricing/voice) page for current rates.

## Usage {#usage}

Amazon voice IDs are composed of four sections:

| Parameter                                                 | Possible values                                                               | Description                             |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `engine`<br/><span class="required-arg">required</span>   | <ul><li>`amazon`</li><li>`polly` (will be deprecated in the future)</li></ul> | TTS engine                              |
| `voice`<br/><span class="required-arg">required</span>    | Choose from the [**Name/ID** column][polly]                                   | Voice ID                                |
| `model`<br/><span class="optional-arg">optional</span>    | `standard`, `neural`, or `generative`                                         | Amazon Polly model. Default: `standard` |
| `language`<br/><span class="optional-arg">optional</span> | Choose from the [**Language code** column][polly]                             | Sets model language. Default: `en-US`   |

Amazon voice IDs conform to the following format:

```
amazon.<voice>:<model>:<language>
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Values | Description |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `engine` | Yes | `amazon` | TTS engine identifier (note: `polly` is deprecated) |
| `voice` | Yes | See [available voices][polly] | Voice name from the Name/ID column |
| `model` | Optional | `standard`, `neural`, `generative` | Amazon Polly model (default: `standard`) |
| `language` | Optional | See [language codes][polly-langs] | Language code (default: `en-US`) |

**Examples:**
```
amazon.Joanna
amazon.Joanna:standard:en-US
amazon.Kendra:neural:en-US
amazon.Matthew:neural:en-US
amazon.Danielle:generative:en-US
amazon.Amy:generative:en-GB
amazon.Aditi:standard:hi-IN
```

**Simplified Format:**

For voices that only support one model, you can omit the model parameter:
```
amazon.<voice>:<language>
```

Example: `amazon.Aditi:hi-IN` (Standard model implied)

:::note
The `polly` engine code is being deprecated. Use `amazon` instead.
:::

:::warning Character limits
Amazon Polly has a limit of 3000 chargeable characters in a single request.
If your TTS request is longer than 3000 characters, you will experience silence.

## Examples {#examples}

See how to use Amazon Polly voices on the SignalWire platform.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="swml" label="SWML">
Use the
[**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages#use-voice-strings)
SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai).
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:
        - name: English
          code: en-US
          voice: amazon.Ruth:neural
```
Alternatively, use the [**`say_voice`** parameter](/swml/methods/play#parameters) 
of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play)
SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - set:
      say_voice: "amazon.Ruth:neural"
  - play: "say:Greetings. This is the Ruth voice from Amazon Polly's Neural text-to-speech model."
