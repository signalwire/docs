## Voice IDs

Amazon voice IDs are composed of four sections:

| Parameter                                                 | Possible values                                                      | Description                             |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `engine`<br/><span class="required-arg">required</span>   | <ul><li>`amazon`</li><li>`polly` (will be deprecated soon)</li></ul> | TTS engine                              |
| `voice`<br/><span class="required-arg">required</span>    | Choose from the [**Name/ID** column][polly]                          | Voice ID                                |
| `model`<br/><span class="optional-arg">optional</span>    | `standard`, `neural`, or `generative`                                | Amazon Polly model. Default: `standard` |
| `language`<br/><span class="optional-arg">optional</span> | Choose from the [**Language code** column][polly]                    | Sets model language. Default: `en-US`   |

Create the voice string according to the following pattern:

```
amazon.voice:model:language
```

### Examples

```bash
# The Danielle voice, which supports the default Standard model and en-US language
amazon.Danielle

# Two equivalent strings for the Standard-model Aditi bilingual voice in the Hindi language
amazon.Aditi:standard:hi-IN
amazon.Aditi:hi-IN

# The Amy Generative model in British English
amazon.Amy:generative:en-GB
```

:::note
The `polly` engine code is being deprecated. Use `amazon` instead.
:::

:::warning Character limits
Amazon Polly has a limit of 3000 chargeable characters in a single request.
If your TTS request is longer than 3000 characters, you will experience silence.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="swml" label="SWML">
Use the
[**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages#use-voice-strings)
SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai).
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:
        - name: English
          code: en-US
          voice: amazon.Ruth:neural
```
Alternatively, use the [**`say_voice`** parameter](/swml/methods/play#parameters) 
of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play)
SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - set:
      say_voice: "amazon.Ruth:neural"
  - play: "say:Greetings. This is the Ruth voice from Amazon Polly's Neural text-to-speech model."
