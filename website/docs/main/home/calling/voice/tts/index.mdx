SignalWire integrates natively with leading third-party text-to-speech (TTS) providers.
This guide describes supported engines, voices, and languages.
Refer to each provider's documentation for up-to-date model details and service information.

## **Compare providers and models** {#providers}

SignalWire's TTS providers offer a wide range of voice engines optimized for various applications.
Select a provider, model, and voice according to the following considerations:

### Supported features

| Engine | Auto-Emotion | Auto-Speed | Streaming | Multi-mode |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| `elevenlabs` | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| `rime` | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `openai` | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| `azure` | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| `deepgram` | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| `cartesia` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `amazon` | No | No | No | Yes |
| `gcloud` | No | No | No | Yes |

**Language support:** 
Some [Rime][rime] voices are English-Spanish bilingual.
[Amazon Polly][polly], [ElevenLabs][elevenlabs], [Google Cloud][gcloud], and [OpenAI][openai] 
offer a wide range of supported languages.
In addition, all [ElevenLabs][elevenlabs] and [OpenAI][openai] voices are fully multilingual.

**SSML support:** Google Cloud and Amazon Polly support 
[SSML](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/say#speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml) 
(Speech Synthesis Markup Language) as a string wrapped in `<speak>` tags. 
Consult [Google Cloud's SSML docs](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml) for details.
Refer to the Amazon Polly docs for more information on 
[using SSML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/ssml.html)
and [supported SSML tags.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supportedtags.html)

## Use voice identifier strings

Compose voice identifier strings using the following general format:

```
engine.voice:model
```

| Identifier                                              | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `engine`<br/><span class="required-arg">required</span> | The TTS provider (e.g., `elevenlabs`, `rime`, `openai`)     |
| `voice`<br/><span class="required-arg">required</span>  | The voice identifier (name or ID depending on engine)       |
| `model`<br/><span class="optional-arg">optional</span>  | Model variant (not all engines support this)                |

:::info Case insensitivity

Since voice ID strings are case insensitive, the following strings are equivalent:
```
gcloud.en-US-Neural2-A
gcloud.en-us-neural2-a
GCLOUD.EN-US-NEURAL2-A
```
:::

For detailed instructions for each provider, consult the voice ID references linked in the **Usage** column of the below table.
