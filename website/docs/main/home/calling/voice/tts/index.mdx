SignalWire's cloud platform integrates with leading third-party text-to-speech (TTS) providers.
This guide describes supported engines, voices, and languages.
Refer to each provider's documentation for up-to-date model details and service information.

## **Compare providers and models** {#providers}

SignalWire's TTS providers offer a wide range of voice engines optimized for various applications.
Select a provider, model, and voice according to the following considerations:

**Cost:** 
When cost-efficiency is the top priority, select a Standard-tier voice from 
[Google Cloud][gcloud] or [Amazon Polly][polly]. 
Review our [pricing information](#pricing) to learn more.

**Language support:** 
Some [Rime][rime] voices are English-Spanish bilingual.
[Amazon Polly][polly], [ElevenLabs][elevenlabs], [Google Cloud][gcloud], and [OpenAI][openai] 
offer a wide range of supported languages.
In addition, all [ElevenLabs][elevenlabs] and [OpenAI][openai] voices are fully multilingual.

**SSML support:** Google Cloud and Amazon Polly support 
[SSML](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/say#speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml) 
(Speech Synthesis Markup Language) as a string wrapped in `<speak>` tags. 
Consult [Google Cloud's SSML docs](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml) for details.
Refer to the Amazon Polly docs for more information on 
[using SSML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/ssml.html)
and [supported SSML tags.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supportedtags.html)

## **Use voice identifier strings**

Compose voice identifier strings using the `<engine>.<voice id>` format.

First, select your engine using the `gcloud`, `polly`, `elevenlabs`, or `deepgram` identifier. 
Append a period (`.`), followed by the specific **voice ID** from the TTS provider.

:::tip Case insensitivity

Voice identifier strings are **case insensitive**.
For example,
`gcloud.en-US-Neural2-A`,
`gcloud.en-us-neural2-a`, and
`GCLOUD.EN-US-NEURAL2-A` are equivalent.
