# Microsoft Azure

Microsoft's Azure platform offers an impressive array of high-quality, multilingual voices in its Neural model.

## Languages

Azure Neural voices are interchangeably compatible with all supported languages.
Rather than setting language with the language `code`,
simply provide input text in the desired language.

Consult the Azure
[supported languages resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=tts)
for an up-to-date list of supported languages.
