# AI Agents in the Dashboard

SignalWire AI Gateway or SWAIG enables functions that allow the virtual agent to perform actions by seamlessly integrating
the virtual AI agent with backend databases or CRM. 
The integrations empower virtual agents with real-time access to relevant data, 
enabling them to handle customer queries more efficiently and deliver high-quality personalized interactions; 
for example, send SMS messages, access customer information, and resolve a support ticket.

## **Creating your first AI Agent**

To get started with your first SignalWire AI Agent, navigate to your SignalWire Space and click on the tab on your sidebar labeled `AI Agents`. 
From here, you can assign your AI Agent a new Agent name. 
Once you have typed in the AI Agent's name, click the `Create` button to finish creating your first SignalWire AI Agent.

</figure>

You should now see your newly created AI Agent show up in the AI Agents list.

</figure>

## **Setting up your AI Agent's settings**
Next, we are going to go over the settings that set up the AI Agent to behave in a specified way. 
You will notice three tabs that are part of the AI Agent: `Prompts`, `Language`, and `Functions`. 
Below, we will go over each of these settings and what role they play for a SignalWire AI Agent.

<figure>
    <img className="img-800" src={require("./swaig-settings.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the Edit page for the new AI Agent." />
</figure>

### Prompts
The AI Agent comes with two settings under the `Prompts` section: `Prompt` and `Post Prompt`.

#### Prompt
The `Prompt` is the initial set of instructions we provide to configure the AI Agent. 
These instructions will act as a guide for the AI to stay within the prompts' description.

Additionally, the prompt section includes an `Advanced Config` section with additional `Prompt` settings.
You can review these additional `Prompt` settings by clicking on the arrow beside `Advanced Config` to expand the settings.

Advanced Prompt Settings:

- `Prompt Confidence`: Threshold to fire a speech-detect event at the end of the utterance.
- `Prompt Top P`: Randomness Setting
- `Temperature`: Randomness Setting

<figure>
    <img className="img-800" src={require("./swaig-prompt-config.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the advanced configurations, showing values for Prompt Confidence, Top P, and Temperature." />
</figure>


#### Post Prompt

The `Post Prompt` section is responsible for handling what actions are taken after the AI Agent Prompt has come to an end.
It includes an `Advanced Config` section as well as a `Post Prompt URL` setting.

Similarly to the Prompt section, Post Prompt's `Advanced Config` comes with additional settings to help expand its capabilities and expected behavior.

- `Post Prompt Top P`: Randomness Setting
- `Post Prompt Temperature`: Randomness Setting

Post Prompt includes a section called `Post Prompt URL`. 
This will be a webhook that the AI Agent will POST to once the Post Prompt is complete. 
This can include status callbacks and reports.

<figure>
    <img className="img-800" src={require("./swaig-post-prompt-advanced-config.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the Post Prompt panel, including a text box, advanced config section, and Post Prompt Url text box." />
</figure>

### AI Agent's Languages
The `Language` section allows us to specify what languages the AI Agent is allowed to use during the conversation. 
One of these specified languages can be set as the default language for the AI to use.

To add a language to your AI Agent, go to the `Languages` section and click on  the `Add Language` button.
From here, you will be able to select the language, gender, and voice the AI will use.

    <img className="img-800" src={require("./swaig-language-settings.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the Add Language panel, with drop-down selectors for Language, Gender, and Voice." />
</figure>

### AI Agent's Functions
The SignalWire AI Agent also has the ability to call defined functions that can execute during the interaction with the AI.

The `Default Webhook URL` setting represents the default URL to which to send status callbacks and reports.
This URL also becomes the default webhook for all functions created for your AI Agent. 
The default webhook URL also has an `Advanced Configuration`section which exposes the following settings when expanded:

- `Default Webhook Auth User`: Default auth username for `web_hook_url` endpoint. Optional. Default is not set.
- `Default Webhook Auth Password`: Default auth password for `web_hook_url` endpoint. Optional. Default is not set.

<figure>
    <img className="img-800" src={require("./swaig-default-url-function.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the Functions tab, showing text boxes labeled Default Web Hook URL, Default Web Hook Auth User, and Default Web Hook Auth Password."/>
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

To get started with creating our first AI Agent Function, click on the `Add Function` button. 
This will open a new page that contains the newly created function's settings.

<figure>
    <img className="img-800" src={require("./swaig-functions.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the Edit page for the AI Agent, showing the Add Function button."/>
</figure>

##### Function Settings

When creating an AI Agent, we will need to declare its purpose, arguments, and the webhook URL you wish for this function
to use.

- `Purpose`: A description of the context and purpose of the function, to explain to the agent when to use it.
- `Arguments`: A JSON object defining the input that should be passed to the function.
- `Webhook URL`: Function-specific URL to send status callbacks and reports to. 
Takes precedence over a default setting.
  If not set, the default webhook URL will become the default webhook URL.

<figure>
    <img className="img-800" src={require("./swaig-function-settings.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the New Function menu."/>
</figure>

Under the webhook URL setting, you will see there is an `Advanced Configuration` section. 
Expand this section by clicking on the arrow to reveal the following settings:

- `Default Webhook Auth User`: Function-specific auth username for `web_hook_url` endpoint. 
Takes precedence over a default setting.
- `Default Webhook Auth Password`: Function-specific auth password for `web_hook_url` endpoint. 
Takes precedence over a default setting.

## **Introducing a practical SignalWire AI Agent â€” Ethan**

Now that we have a general understanding of how to use the SignalWire, let's introduce Ethan. 
Ethan is a practical, working example of how you can leverage the SignalWire AI Agent to create a personal assistant. 
He has the ability to take messages, and forward them as an SMS to the individual he is assisting. 
He also has the ability to fetch the weather of any city upon request. 
Finally, the last functionality that Ethan is capable of is trivia!
Ethan will use a trivia API to pull random trivia questions into the call for the user to answer.

## **Build your own Ethan**

Now with the understanding of the AI Agent and the logic that helps Ethan function, you can replicate Ethan into your own SignalWire Space to test out. 
Just follow the steps above to create an AI Agent, and then replicate Ethan's settings. 
Once all set, assign the AI Agent to a SignalWire number, and then call it to give it a test!
