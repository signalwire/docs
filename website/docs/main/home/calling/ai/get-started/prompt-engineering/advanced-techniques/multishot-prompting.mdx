# Multishot Prompting

<Subtitle>Use examples to guide AI behavior and improve consistency in responses</Subtitle>

## What is Multishot Prompting?

Multishot prompting, also known as example-based prompting or few-shot learning, is a powerful technique where you provide multiple examples to guide the AI's behavior. By showing the AI several examples of desired input-output patterns, you create a clear template for it to follow, significantly improving consistency and quality of responses.

This technique is particularly valuable in SignalWire AI Agent contexts where consistent, predictable responses are essential for user experience across voice and video interactions.

## How Multishot Prompting Works

The core principle behind multishot prompting is simple: instead of describing what you want in abstract terms, you show the AI what successful responses look like through concrete examples. This approach helps the AI infer patterns and expectations without requiring explicit rules for every scenario.

### Basic Structure

A typical multishot prompt follows this structure:

```markdown
I want you to respond to customer inquiries about our product. Here are some examples:

Customer: "How much does your basic plan cost?"
Response: "Our basic plan is $19 per month and includes up to 1,000 minutes of call time. Would you like to know about our other plans as well?"

Customer: "Do you support video calls?"
Response: "Yes, our platform supports high-quality video calls on both desktop and mobile devices. You can host up to 50 participants on a single call with our standard plan."

Customer: "Can I try before I buy?"
Response: "Absolutely! We offer a 14-day free trial with full access to all features. No credit card is required to start your trial. Would you like me to guide you through setting up a trial account?"

Now, please respond to this customer inquiry:
Customer: "What programming languages do you support?"
```

### Components of Effective Multishot Prompts

1. **Clear Introduction**: State the general task or role the AI should perform
2. **Representative Examples**: Provide diverse examples that cover the range of expected interactions
3. **Pattern Consistency**: Maintain a consistent pattern across examples
4. **Transition**: Clearly indicate when examples end and the actual task begins
5. **Initial Input**: Provide the first real input for the AI to respond to

## Benefits for SignalWire AI Agents

Multishot prompting offers several key advantages when working with SignalWire AI Agents:

### Improved Consistency

By providing explicit examples, you establish clear patterns for responses, ensuring consistency across similar queries. This is especially important for voice agents where users expect predictable interaction patterns.

### Format Control

Examples demonstrate not just content but also format, helping ensure responses follow your preferred structure without having to explicitly code all formatting rules.

### Enhanced Quality

Well-chosen examples elevate the overall quality of responses by demonstrating best practices, preferred tone, and optimal level of detail.

### Reduced Hallucination

Concrete examples help ground the AI's responses in reality, reducing the likelihood of the AI making up information or veering off into irrelevant territory.

### Implicit Rule Learning

Instead of explicitly coding every rule, multishot prompting allows the AI to infer implicit patterns and rules from your examples.

## Best Practices for Multishot Prompting

### Example Selection and Creation

```markdown
# Example Selection Guidelines

When creating examples for multishot prompts:

## Coverage Requirements
- Include examples representing the full range of expected user inputs
- Cover both common and edge-case scenarios
- Represent different user demographics and communication styles
- Include examples with varying complexity levels

## Quality Standards
- Ensure each example perfectly demonstrates your ideal response
- Align examples with your specific business requirements
- Verify technical accuracy in all examples
- Maintain consistent tone and style across examples

## Diversity Considerations
- Vary the length and structure of responses appropriately
- Include different types of queries (information requests, problem solving, etc.)
- Demonstrate different emotional contexts (neutral, concerned, excited)
- Show appropriate handling of both complete and incomplete user inputs
```

### Example Quantity and Order

The number of examples you include matters:

- **0-shot**: No examples, just instructions (least effective for complex tasks)
- **1-shot**: Single example (limited but better than zero-shot)
- **Few-shot**: 2-5 examples (often the sweet spot for many applications)
- **Many-shot**: 6+ examples (can be useful for complex patterns but watch for context window limits)

The order of examples also influences the AI's behavior:

```markdown
# Example Ordering Strategies

## Primacy-Recency Balance
- Place highest priority patterns in both first and last positions
- Use middle examples for edge cases or less common scenarios

## Complexity Progression
- Start with simpler examples
- Gradually increase complexity
- End with examples most similar to expected real-world inputs

## Priority-Based Ordering
- Lead with the most critical examples that exemplify essential behavior
- Place lower-priority patterns toward the middle
- Close with a strong example that reinforces key patterns
```

<Admonition type="warning">
For voice applications with SignalWire AI Agents, be mindful of context window limitations. Too many examples may limit the AI's ability to process the full conversation history in long interactions.

### Example Framing

How you frame examples significantly impacts their effectiveness:

```markdown
# Example Framing Guidelines

## Clear Delimiters
- Clearly mark the beginning and end of each example
- Use consistent formatting for user inputs vs AI responses
- Consider using labels like "Customer:" and "Response:"

## Contextual Information
- Include relevant context that influenced the response
- Add annotations explaining why certain responses are preferred
- Highlight key features the example demonstrates

## Format Consistency
- Maintain identical formatting patterns across all examples
- Use the same delimiter symbols throughout
- Keep consistent paragraph structures and spacing
```

## Voice and Video Applications

For SignalWire AI voice and video applications, multishot prompting requires special considerations:

```markdown
# Voice-Specific Multishot Guidelines

## Include Conversational Elements
- Demonstrate natural turn-taking patterns
- Show recovery patterns for misheard information
- Include examples of appropriate interruption handling

## Speech Characteristics
- Demonstrate preferred pacing through punctuation
- Show appropriate pausing with [pause] tags if necessary
- Include examples of emphasis for key information

## Temporal Considerations
- Include examples of varying lengths to demonstrate appropriate verbosity
- Show how to handle time-sensitive information
- Demonstrate proper response when information is time-limited
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Customer Support Agent

```markdown
# Customer Support Voice Agent Examples

You are a helpful customer support agent for SignalWire. Respond to customer inquiries following these examples:

Customer: "I'm having trouble connecting my application to your API."
Agent: "I understand connecting to our API can sometimes be challenging. Could you tell me what programming language you're using and what specific error message you're seeing? This will help me provide the most relevant solution."

Customer: "Do you have a free tier for testing?"
Agent: "Yes, we do offer a free tier that's perfect for testing. You get $5 of credit to start, which is enough to thoroughly test our voice, video, and messaging capabilities. No credit card is required to sign up. Would you like me to explain how to create a free account?"

Customer: "Your service is too expensive compared to your competitors."
Agent: "I appreciate your feedback about our pricing. We strive to deliver premium quality and reliability, which does factor into our cost structure. However, I'd be happy to discuss your specific usage patterns to see if there's a plan that might be more cost-effective for your needs. Could you tell me more about your typical monthly usage?"

Customer: "The call quality on my last conference was poor."
Agent: "I'm sorry to hear about the poor call quality during your conference. This isn't the experience we want for you. To help diagnose the issue, could you share a few details like the time of the call, how many participants were connected, and whether you noticed any specific issues like audio cutting out or video freezing? With that information, I can work with you to investigate and resolve the problem."

Now respond to this customer inquiry:
Customer: "How do I implement your video API in my React application?"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Inconsistent Results

If you're experiencing inconsistent results with multishot prompting:

1. **Examine Pattern Clarity**: Ensure your examples demonstrate clear, consistent patterns
2. **Check Example Diversity**: Verify your examples cover the range of expected inputs
3. **Review Example Order**: Consider rearranging examples to prioritize the most important patterns
4. **Add Explicit Instructions**: Complement examples with clear written instructions about expectations

### Example Overfitting

Sometimes the AI mimics examples too literally. To fix this:

1. **Add Variety**: Include examples with structural variations
2. **Explicitly State Flexibility**: Add instructions about where the AI can be creative vs. where it must follow patterns precisely
3. **Include Abstract Principles**: Supplement examples with general rules that explain the underlying logic

### Boundary Testing

To ensure your multishot prompt handles edge cases:

1. **Include Challenging Examples**: Add examples that demonstrate handling of unusual or difficult inputs
2. **Test Systematically**: After implementation, test with inputs that push the boundaries of your example set
3. **Iterate Based on Results**: Add new examples to address any gaps discovered during testing
