# Generation Tasks in Prompt Engineering

<Subtitle>Learn how to craft prompts that generate high-quality content for various use cases</Subtitle>

## Overview

Generation tasks involve creating new content, from simple responses to complex structured outputs. In the SignalWire context, these tasks often involve generating voice responses, chat messages, documentation, or configuration files. 

This guide focuses on best practices for crafting prompts that produce consistent, high-quality generated content across different use cases.

## Task Categories

Generation tasks for SignalWire AI Agents typically fall into several categories, each with its own considerations and best practices.

### Voice Interaction Generation

Voice interaction prompts guide the AI in generating spoken responses that sound natural and engaging:

```markdown
# Voice Response Generation Guidelines

## Conversational Style
- Use contractions and informal language when appropriate
- Incorporate brief pauses for natural speech rhythm
- Vary sentence structure to maintain engagement

## Response Structure
- Keep spoken sentences under 15 words when possible
- Front-load important information
- Use verbal signposting for complex topics ("First... Next... Finally...")

## Delivery Considerations
- Provide pronunciation guidance for technical terms and acronyms
- Indicate where emphasis should be placed
- Include instructions for tone shifts based on context
```

<Admonition type="tip">
For voice applications, always test your generated content by listening to it. What reads well as text may not sound natural when spoken aloud.

### Documentation Generation

Documentation prompts help the AI create clear, structured information resources:

```markdown
# Documentation Generator Guidelines

## Content Structure
- Begin with a concise overview (1-2 sentences)
- Use hierarchical headings (H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)
- Include a "Quick Start" section before detailed instructions

## Code Examples
- Provide examples in multiple languages when applicable
- Include comments explaining key components
- Start with simple examples before complex implementations

## Technical Accuracy
- Define all parameters with type information
- Specify required vs. optional elements
- Include expected responses and error scenarios
```

### Configuration Generation

Configuration generation prompts guide the AI in creating valid, optimal configuration settings:

```markdown
# Configuration Generator Guidelines

## Format Requirements
- Use valid JSON/YAML/XML syntax with proper indentation
- Include comments explaining non-obvious settings
- Group related configuration elements

## Security Considerations
- Never generate hard-coded credentials
- Include placeholder markers for sensitive information
- Add security best practice notes alongside relevant settings

## Optimization Guidelines
- Suggest sensible defaults based on common use cases
- Include performance impact notes for resource-intensive settings
- Provide scaling recommendations for different deployment sizes
```

## Best Practices for Content Generation

### Planning and Structure

Before diving into detailed generation instructions, establish a clear plan and structure:

```markdown
# Response Generation Planning

## Response Blueprint
- Greeting personalized to user context
- Acknowledgment of user's question/request
- Direct answer/resolution (2-3 sentences)
- Follow-up action or verification
- Closing with next steps

## Content Hierarchy
1. Essential information (must include)
2. Supporting details (include if relevant)
3. Additional context (include if beneficial)
4. Alternative options (include if applicable)

## Preparation Steps
- Identify key information needed before generating response
- Determine appropriate level of technical detail
- Select suitable tone based on user context
```

#### Do
- Create a clear structural template for consistent outputs
- Define content hierarchy and prioritization
- Establish preparation steps before generation

#### Don't
- Skip the planning phase
- Generate without structural guidance
- Leave content organization to chance

### Content Development Guidelines

Provide detailed guidance on developing high-quality content:

```markdown
# Content Quality Guidelines

## Clarity Standards
- Prefer active voice over passive
- Use concrete, specific examples
- Define technical terms on first use
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout

## Engagement Techniques
- Use conversational transitions between topics
- Incorporate relevant analogies for complex concepts
- Ask confirming questions at appropriate intervals
- Adapt complexity based on user expertise signals

## Content Customization
- Personalize examples to user's industry when known
- Reference previous interactions for continuity
- Adjust technical depth based on user's responses
- Maintain consistent voice while adapting content
```

#### Do
- Provide specific guidance on language and style
- Include techniques for engagement and personalization
- Establish clear quality standards

#### Don't
- Use vague descriptions of desired quality
- Ignore the importance of engagement
- Overlook personalization opportunities

### Quality Assurance Instructions

Include explicit quality assurance guidance in your generation prompts:

```markdown
# Quality Verification Steps

Before delivering generated content, verify:

## Accuracy Check
- Technical information is current and correct
- Recommendations align with SignalWire best practices
- Pricing or plan information is accurate
- Links and references point to valid resources

## Completeness Verification
- All required elements are present
- Edge cases and exceptions are addressed
- The user's original question is fully answered
- Next steps or alternatives are provided when appropriate

## Usability Assessment
- Content is organized logically
- Critical information is prominently positioned
- Technical level matches user's demonstrated expertise
- Actionable items are clearly highlighted
```

#### Do
- Build QA steps directly into generation prompts
- Create verification checklists
- Emphasize both technical accuracy and usability

#### Don't
- Assume generation will be correct without verification
- Focus only on technical accuracy without considering usability
- Skip completeness checks

## Examples of Effective Generation Prompts

DO: Include natural pauses and emphasis markers
DON'T: Create responses that rely on visual information
```

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- **Be specific about format**: "Generate a step-by-step troubleshooting guide with 5-7 steps"
- **Provide structural templates**: "Follow this structure: Overview → Steps → Verification → Next Actions"
- **Include quality criteria**: "Ensure all code examples are functional and include error handling"
- **Set contextual parameters**: "Generate content appropriate for a technical audience familiar with API integration"
- **Specify voice characteristics**: "Use conversational language with contractions and simple sentence structure"

### Don't

- **Be vague about deliverables**: "Create some documentation about our video API"
- **Ignore medium-specific requirements**: "Generate a script" without voice-specific guidelines
- **Skip format specifications**: "Provide a configuration example" without syntax requirements
- **Leave tone undefined**: "Write a welcome message" without specifying tone or style
- **Forget audience adaptation**: "Explain our product" without audience expertise guidance

## SignalWire-Specific Generation Considerations

When crafting generation prompts for SignalWire AI Agents, consider these platform-specific best practices:

- Avoid complex numerical information that's difficult to process audibly

## Multimodal Considerations
- For video interactions, specify what information should be emphasized visually
- Include instructions for synchronizing spoken and visual information
- Provide guidance for maintaining eye contact during video interactions
- Specify when to reference visual elements vs. when to describe them
```
