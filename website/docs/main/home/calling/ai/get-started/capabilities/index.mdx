## Core capabilities

### Voice technology

SignalWire's voice technology provides comprehensive control over how your AI agents sound and understand speech. 
The platform enables you to select from multiple Text-to-Speech providers and fine-tune voice parameters to perfectly match your brand identity.
Natural speech <Tooltips tip="A user can define what words or phrases to say during pauses in the conversation. These pauses can occur from function calls or speech down time.">fillers</Tooltips>
maintain smooth conversation flow during processing pauses, while real-time audio processing handles noise filtering and accent variations
with precision.

### Conversation intelligence

SignalWire AI revolutionizes how agents handle complex conversations. Unlike traditional IVR systems that follow rigid
decision trees, our AI agents operate with natural fluidity. They excel at maintaining their assigned role while juggling multiple
conversation threads, seamlessly interfacing with backend systems without breaking natural dialogue flow. 
Perhaps most importantly, they can handle unexpected topic changes without losing context, ensuring a more human-like interaction.

The below diagrams illustrate how a customer might schedule a medical appointment using a conventional IVR ("interactive voice response", left), compared to using a SignalWire AI Agent (right).

For example, when a caller asks "What about the premium version?", the AI understands this refers to a product discussed
earlier in the conversation. This context awareness extends across different topics and requests within the same interaction, allowing for natural conversation
flows like:

"I'd like to schedule an appointment" → "What time works for you?" → "Actually, before we do that, what's your cancellation policy?"

The AI handles these context switches seamlessly while maintaining the original intent to schedule an appointment.

### Dynamic context switching

One powerful way to structure conversations is through <Tooltips tip="Contexts are specialized topics or roles that an AI agent can handle. Each context has its own specialized prompt, fresh conversation memory, and its own steps to follow through the conversation.">
contexts</Tooltips>. Instead of transferring callers between departments like a traditional system, your AI agent can switch context internally
to handle different topics & requests within the same conversation.

Each context operates as an independent entity with its own specialized prompt, fresh conversation memory, 
and focused expertise in areas such as technical support, billing, or sales. This independence is maintained through strict information
boundaries that ensure clear separation between different roles.

This sophisticated approach enables several key benefits. The system can intelligently route each task to the most appropriate specialized context
while controlling information flow between contexts. It maintains natural conversation flow during role transitions and implements
robust security boundaries for sensitive operations. The result is a system that delivers specialized knowledge within appropriate contexts,
prevents information bleed between different roles, and maintains clear compliance and security boundaries while delivering purpose-built
responses for each domain.

For example, when a customer moves from technical support to billing questions, the AI swaps context to focus solely on financial
matters, leaving technical details in the previous context. This isolation maintains security while ensuring each
interaction benefits from specialized expertise.

Below is an example of a context switch in a customer support scenario for both a traditional IVR and a SignalWire AI Agent.

### Real-time analytics and monitoring

The platform provides comprehensive analytics to understand and optimize your AI agents' performance. 
It continuously captures vital metrics including conversation flow and role adherence, speech recognition accuracy, response timing and latency,
voice quality metrics, and integration performance. This wealth of data flows through a robust webhook system that enables
real-time conversation monitoring, performance metric tracking, human supervision when needed, and ongoing agent behavior optimization.

Here's how this works in a customer support scenario:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Customer
    participant A as AI Agent
    participant W as Webhook

    C->>A: Asks about product return
    Note over A: Processes request
    A->>W: Sends interaction data
    Note over W: Analytics Processing

    Note over W: Real-time updates:<br/>- Speech confidence: 0.876<br/>- Response time: 850ms<br/>- Language: en-US
```

#### Webhook data and metrics

Here's an example of the data you receive during an AI interaction:

```json
{
  "call_info": {
    "project_id": "b08dacad...",
    "content_type": "text/json",
    "call_id": "b3f4e4e1..."
  },
  "conversation_add": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "...",
    "lang": "en-US",
    "tokens": 53,
    "latency": 836,

  },
  "webhook_reply": {
    "status": "OK",
    "request_id": "341de258...",
    "parameters": {
      "query": "...",
    },
    "data": {...}
  }
}
```

## Integration & architecture

### External service integration

SignalWire AI connects with your business systems through its function framework. When your agent needs to perform an action - like checking inventory or booking an appointment - it can call functions that interact with your databases and services while keeping the conversation natural.

Here's an example of scheduling a meeting:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
            autonumber
            
            participant Customer
            participant AI
            participant Functions
            participant CalAPI as Calendar API
            participant SMS

            %% Initial Request
            Customer->>+AI: I need to schedule a meeting with the sales team
            Note right of AI: Detects scheduling intent
            AI-->>AI: Identifies scheduling need
            AI->>-Customer: I can help. When is best for you next week?
            
            %% Time Selection
            Customer->>+AI: Tuesday afternoon would be great
            
            %% Availability Check
            Note over AI,CalAPI: Checking team availability
            AI->>+Functions: check_team_availability()
            Functions->>+CalAPI: Query sales team calendar
            CalAPI-->>-Functions: Return available slots
            Functions-->>-AI: Provide available times
            
            AI->>-Customer: The sales team is free at 2 PM or 4 PM on Tuesday
            Customer->>+AI: 2 PM works perfectly
            
            %% Meeting Setup
            Note over AI,CalAPI: Scheduling the meeting
            AI->>+Functions: schedule_meeting()
            Functions->>+CalAPI: Create event and send invites
            CalAPI-->>-Functions: Confirm booking and invites sent
            
            %% Notifications
            Note over Functions,SMS: Sending notifications
            Functions->>Functions: Trigger SMS notification
            Functions->>+SMS: Send confirmation text
            SMS-->>-Functions: Confirm delivery status
            
            Functions-->>-AI: Confirm meeting setup
            AI->>-Customer: Meeting scheduled for Tuesday at 2 PM
            Note over Customer,AI: You'll receive a calendar invite and a confirmation SMS
```

The process works like this:

1. Your agent recognizes when a request needs external data or actions
2. It calls the appropriate function
3. The function handles the technical work with your systems
4. Your agent incorporates the results naturally into the conversation

This lets you automate complex processes without exposing the technical details to your users.
