# Route inbound calls to LiveKit with SWML `connect`

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need the following:

  - a [SignalWire Space][signup]
  - a [LiveKit account][livekit]
  - a [SignalWire phone number][buy-phone]

## Inbound

This guide will walk you through configuring **inbound SIP calls** using **LiveKit** and **SignalWire**. 

In this guide, we will route inbound SIP calls from SignalWire to the LiveKit platform.

<Steps>

### Configure SignalWire

To route inbound calls to LiveKit, you will need to create a SWML script that handles the call routing.

**Create an SWML Script**

  - Log in to your SignalWire dashboard and navigate to the **Resources** tab on the left-hand sidebar.
  - Click **Add**, select **Script**, and then choose **SWML Script**.
  - Paste the following SWML code snippet into the editor:

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
   main:
      - connect:
           to: sip:%{call.to}@your-unique-SIP-domain-from-Livekit.com
```

Be sure to replace `your-unique-SIP-domain-from-Livekit.com` with the SIP domain from your LiveKit settings
(for example, `241ozqza.sip.livekit.cloud`).
Find this domain under **LiveKit Settings** labeled as **SIP URI**.

  - Save the SWML script once the modifications are complete.

### Assign the SWML Script to a Phone Number

  - Go to the **Phone Numbers** section in your SignalWire account.
  - Select the **Edit Settings** option for the phone number you want to use for inbound calls.
  - Click **Assign Resource** and choose the SWML script you just created.

This ensures that incoming calls to the designated SignalWire phone number follow the routing path defined in the SWML script.

### Configure LiveKit

Next, we will configure a SIP trunk in LiveKit to handle calls routed from SignalWire. 
Follow the official LiveKit 
[SIP trunk inbound guide](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/trunk-inbound/) 
for further information.

### Add a LiveKit SIP Trunk

  - Create a new SIP trunk using the following configuration:

    ```json
    {
      "trunk": {
        "name": "My trunk",
        "numbers": ["+1XXXXXXXXXX"]
      }
    }
    ```

Be sure to replace `+1XXXXXXXXXX` with the SignalWire phone number you assigned previously. 
Ensure the number is formatted in E.164 format.

  - Submit your configuration.

</Steps>

After completing this setup, you can use LiveKit's dispatch rules to determine how incoming calls should be handled.
Consult LiveKit's 
[Dispatch Rules Guide(https://docs.livekit.io/sip/dispatch-rule/)
for guidance on managing call routing.

## Troubleshooting

- If calls are not reaching LiveKit:
    - Verify that the **SIP domain** in your SWML script matches your LiveKit settings.
    - Ensure your phone number is correctly formatted in the trunk configuration.

You're all set to start handling inbound calls with LiveKit and SignalWire. If you need further assistance, consult the [LiveKit documentation](https://docs.livekit.io) or reach out to SignalWire support.

## Outbound

This guide will help you set up outbound SIP calls using LiveKit and SignalWire.
Follow these steps to configure your SIP domain, SWML script, and LiveKit settings efficiently.

<Steps>

### Create an SWML Script

  - Log in to your SignalWire space.
  - Navigate to the **Resources** tab on the left-hand sidebar.
  - Click **Add**, select **Script**, and then choose **SWML Script**.
  - Use the following SWML script, ensuring to replace the `from` field with a valid phone number from your SignalWire project:

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - connect:
        answer_on_bridge: true
        from: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
        to: "%{call.to.replace(/^sip:/i, '').replace(/@.*/, '')}"
```

Be sure to replace `"+1XXXXXXXXXX"` with a phone number from your SignalWire account.

### Add SIP Address to Your Script

  - Save the SWML script and navigate to the **Addresses & Phone Numbers** section within the script.
  - Click **Add** and select **SIP Address** to add your SIP domain application.
  - Configure this SIP address based on your requirements, and save it.
  - After configuration, note down your unique SIP domain.

   Example SIP domain: `test-space-live-kit.dapp.signalwire.com`.

</Steps>

Now, let’s configure LiveKit for outbound SIP calling. 
Follow along with LiveKit’s documentation for [outbound SIP trunk setup](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/trunk-outbound/).

<Steps>

### Create an Outbound Trunk

Use the following JSON configuration for creating an outbound SIP trunk, ensuring you update the given fields:

```json
{
   "trunk": {
      "name": "My Outbound SIP Trunk",
      "address": "test-space-livekit.dapp.signalwire.com",
      "numbers": ["+15105550100"],
      "auth_username": "<username>",
      "auth_password": "<password>",
      "transport": 3
   }
}
```

Update placeholders in the above JSON with the following:

| Placeholder | Replace with |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| `"address"` | The SIP domain you created previously (e.g., `test-space-live-kit.dapp.signalwire.com`). |
| `numbers`   | A SignalWire phone number.                                                               |
| `<username>` and `<password>` | The credentials provided by SignalWire Support. Contact Support if needed. |

Submit this request and save the generated `Trunk ID`. 
If you forget to save the Trunk ID, use LiveKit’s CLI tool to retrieve the trunk configurations.

### Create a SIP Participant

To initiate outbound calls through your configured trunk, you'll need to create a SIP participant in LiveKit. 
This process establishes the connection and manages the call flow. 
For detailed instructions on creating SIP participants and handling outbound calls, 
refer to LiveKit's comprehensive guide to
[Creating a SIP Participant](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/outbound-calls/#creating-a-sip-participant).

If you're working with LiveKit AI agents for outbound calls, please see
the [LiveKit AI Agent Telephony Guide](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/telephony/).

### Final checks
- Ensure the trunk address matches exactly with the one created previously.
- Phone numbers must be in E.164 format (e.g., "+15105550100") to ensure proper routing and connectivity.

</Steps>

## Conclusion

You’re now ready to make your first outbound SIP call using LiveKit and SignalWire. 
If you encounter any issues, verify the configurations for both SignalWire and LiveKit.

## Inbound Call Recording

To record inbound calls, add the `record_call` method to your existing inbound SWML script:
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - record_call:
      format: mp3
  - connect:
      to: sip:%{call.to}@your-unique-SIP-domain-from-Livekit-goes-here.com
```
---

## Outbound Call Recording
For outbound calls, the setup requires two steps:
1. Create a Recording Script:
    - Navigate to your SignalWire dashboard > **Resources** > **Add** > **Script** > **SWML Script**
    - Paste in the below into your editor.
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - record_call:
      format: mp3
```
1. Update Your Outbound SWML Script:
    - Add the `confirm` parameter to your existing outbound script
    - Set its value to the recording script's URL:
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - connect:
        answer_on_bridge: true
        confirm: "your-recording-script-url"
        from: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
        to: "%{call.to.replace(/^sip:/i, '').replace(/@.*/, '')}"
```
---

## Accessing Recordings
You can access your recordings in two ways:
1. Through the SignalWire Dashboard:
    - Navigate to the **Storage** tab
    - Select the **Recordings** sub-tab

2. Via API:
    - Use the [Recordings List API endpoint](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/recordings-list)

## Call Logging
1. Go to your SignalWire Space
2. Navigate to **Logs** on the sidebar
3. Click on any call to inspect its events and actions
