# AI

<Subtitle>Programmable, integrated, realtime voice AI</Subtitle>

SignalWire AI is built for **unlimited programmability and scale**.
Integrate AI and deploy a MVP with low-code/no-code drag-and-drop tools, then scale your application on SignalWire's cloud platform.

What makes SignalWire AI different?

- **Telecom stack:** SignalWire is built by the creators and maintainers of FreeSWITCHÂ®, 
the leading open-source communication framework that powers some of the world's largest telephony infrastructures.
Other voice AI providers must outsource their telecom integrations, limiting the depth and efficiency of their implementations, and sometimes resulting in higher cost to the developer.

- **Deep integration:** SignalWire's AI is built on our own telecom stack, giving SignalWire the ability to optimize further than others. 
This means lower latency, better performance, and greater extensibility and programmability.

## SignalWire Markup Language (SWML) {#SWML}

SWML is the powerful, lightweight, and extensible markup language for orchestrating real-time call flows that enables SignalWire AI.

SWML Scripts are JSON or YAML files, which can be edited, hosted, and deployed in a number of ways:
serverlessly in the 
<Tooltips tip="The Dashboard is your control panel for all things SignalWire, accessed at `{your-space-name}.signalwire.com`.<br/><br/>[Learn more](/platform/dashboard)</a>">SignalWire Dashboard</Tooltips>,
hosted externally on your own server,
or generated and hosted by your own application using the Agents SDK.

## How does it work?

Under the hood, the SignalWire AI Gateway (SWAIG) orchestrates the many supporting services
that make integrated realtime voice AI possible.

- AI Agent
- Prompt
- LLM
- SWAIG Functions
- TTS (Text-To-Speech) Providers
