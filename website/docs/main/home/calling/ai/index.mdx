# AI

<Subtitle>Programmable, integrated, realtime voice AI</Subtitle>

<br/><br/>

SignalWire AI is built for **unlimited programmability and scale**.
Integrate AI and deploy a MVP with low-code/no-code drag-and-drop tools, then scale your application on SignalWire's cloud platform.

## Try it out

## SWML

SWML (SignalWire Markup Language) is the most powerful and flexible way to use AI on the SignalWire platform.

SWML is a structured language for configuring and orchestrating real-time communication applications
using lightweight and readable JSON or YAML files.
These SWML Scripts can be deployed serverlessly in SignalWire's cloud, or from your server.

SWML's `ai` method integrates advanced AI Agents, which can interact with external APIs.

## How does it work?

Under the hood, the SignalWire AI Gateway (SWAIG) orchestrates the many supporting services
that make integrated realtime voice AI possible.

- AI Agent
- Prompt
- LLM
- SWAIG Functions
- TTS (Text-To-Speech) Providers
