Today we are releasing version 3.7 of the RELAY Realtime SDK. There are a couple of improvements and several fixes.

## Improvements

- We have added the method `.collect()` to the Voice call object. This is similar to the input collection method `prompt`, but there is no prompt element. The collecting session can run silently until your configuration conditions are met. [a937768](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/a937768a0b965d35b8468324a5d85273fc46e638)

For example when collecting speech input:

```js
const collect = await call.collect({
  speech: {
    endSilenceTimeout: 2,
    speechTimeout: 10,
    language: "en-US",
    hints: ["sales", "support", "representative"],
  },
});
const { type, speech } = await collect.ended();
```

- The `playback.failed` event will now be emitted on playback failure. [9ad158b](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/9ad158b90f73bed038d18f7f8b745931c266c3cf)

- For SIP calls, we have added a `sessionTimeout` parameter on the methods `connectSip` and `dialSip` to include a session time limit in the SIP `Session-Expires` header. The default is 600 seconds.

## Fixes

- Fixed a bug between `getRoomSessions` and nested objects in the Video client that was causing an error on `recording.stop`. [fe3b0e2](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/fe3b0e29880bfd6259e9a05acb2a40fbc3fda02b)
- Fixed a bug to now resolve `ended()` promises in case of failure in `playback`, `prompt`, `recording`, `detect`, `collect`, or `tap` methods. [9ad158b](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/9ad158b90f73bed038d18f7f8b745931c266c3cf)
- Fixed logic in `call.received` handlers to better track state in voice calls. [45536d5](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/45536d5fb6a8e474a2f5b511ddf12fb474566b19)
