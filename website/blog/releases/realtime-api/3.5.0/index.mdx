Version 3.5 of the Realtime SDK is here! Highlights include RTMP outbound streaming and methods to retrieve metadata in video rooms.

## Highlights

### Outbound Streaming
We are excited to offer RTMP streaming out of video rooms with the addition of several methods and events! [f1102bb](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/f1102bb6817f119b2f7b063c7e1e5ab2be4e8ec5)

#### New Methods
- `roomSession.startStream()` starts streaming the audio and video of the current room to an external service such as Facebook or YouTube. You can use the returned `RoomSessionStream` object to interact with the stream.

```javascript
const stream = await roomSession.startStream({ url: "rtmp://example.com" });
// Stop the stream after 60 seconds
setTimeout(() => stream.stop(), 60000);
```

- `roomSessionStream.stop()` is a method on the `RoomSessionStream` object returned from the `startStream` method and is used to stop the stream.

```javascript
await stream.stop()
```

- `roomSession.getStreams()` obtains a list of active streams for the current `RoomSession`.

```javascript
const s = await roomSession.getStreams();
for (const stream of s.streams) {
  console.log(stream.id, stream.url);
}
```

#### New Events
- `stream.started`
- `stream.ended`

Emitted when a stream is started or stopped, respectively. Your event handler receives a stream object of the `RoomSessionStream` type.

### Getting Metadata
Our last release included methods to manage metadata on Video Room sessions and the members in the session. Today, we are introducing methods to retrieve the metadata for the room session and a member. [6cf01e1](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/6cf01e1cecfc30395691aae68b6be15de140bd41)

- `getMeta` will return the metadata assigned to the current room session. For example:

```javascript
const { meta } = await room.getMeta();
console.log(meta);
```

- `getMemberMeta` will return the metadata assigned to a specified member. If a member id is not passed, this method will return the metadata from the current member. For example:

```javascript
const { meta } = await room.getMemberMeta({ memberId: 'ab123c0c-4fac-5def-b06f-d5b8614b8999' });
console.log(meta);
```
