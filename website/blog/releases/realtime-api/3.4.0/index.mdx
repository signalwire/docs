Version 3.4.0 of the Realtime SDK is here! We have added several methods, improved event handling, and fixed some bugs. Here are the highlights.

## Highlights

### Manage Metadata
We have added several new methods to manage metadata in a Video room session.  [d7ce34d](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/d7ce34d3e0a54952321b3186abcbad3cd97b7f81)
- `roomSession.updateMeta` updates the room's metadata only in specified fields. This is different from the existing method `setMeta` which replaces the whole metadata object.
- `roomSession.deleteMeta` deletes specific keys from the metadata of the current room session.
- `roomSession.updateMemberMeta` updates a member's metadata only in specified fields. The existing method `setMemberMeta` replaces the whole metadata object.
- `roomSession.deleteMemberMeta` deletes specific keys from the metadata of the desired member.

These four methods work similarly. Let's look at `updateMeta` as an example.
```js
roomSession.on("room.updated", (e) => {
  // We can set an event listener to log changes to the metadata.
  console.log(e.room.meta);
});
await roomSession.setMeta({ foo: "bar", baz: true });
// The log will print { foo: "bar", baz: true },
await roomSession.updateMeta({ baz: false, t: 10 });
// After the call to `updateMeta` our log will print { foo: "bar", baz: false, t: 10 }.
```

Note that for any of these methods, you must specify the `room.set_meta` permission when creating the Video Room Token.

## Other Improvements
- Updated  `RoomSession.getRecordings` and `RoomSession.getPlaybacks` to return stateful objects and deprecated  `RoomSession.recordings` in favour of the getter methods. [eb1c3fe](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/eb1c3fe985767f747747ca0525b1c0710af862cb)
- Exposed `client.disconnect()` methods on all of the client objects in Video, Chat, PubSub, Task, Voice, and Messaging. [7b19610](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/7b196107f120db410c5f85a3fd20682bacbf7576)
- Reviewed socket closed event handling to improve connection retries. [7bdd7ab](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/7bdd7ab03414a4b9aa337e9d6b339891c8feda36)

## Fixes
- Always connect the lower-level client without waiting for an event listener. [7b19610](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/7b196107f120db410c5f85a3fd20682bacbf7576)
- Removed `updateToken`  method and `session.expiring` event from the Realtime API Chat and PubSub because they only need to be accessed from the JavaScript API. [f421f92](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/f421f92a05287b1d8da21e8fc428e42c61afffdf)
