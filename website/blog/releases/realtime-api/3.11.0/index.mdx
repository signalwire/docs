## Highlights

This new release of version 3.11 of the Realtime SDK introduces improvements and new additions to Voice and Video.

## Additional Methods Added To `CallRecording`

- **pause**: Ability to pause an active recording on a call.
```js
const recording = await call.recordingAudio({ direction: "both"});
...
await recording.pause();
```

- **resume**: Ability to resume a paused recording on a call.
```js
const recording = await call.recordingAudio({ direction: "both"});
...
await recording.resume();
```

## `detectInterruptions` Addition

This allows the application to restart message delivery to the answering machine when speech activity is detected after the detector is in a `READY` state.

```js
// Start the detector
const detector = await call.amd({ detectInterruptions: true})
```

## New Alias For Context: `topic`
Now `context` or `contexts` will have a valid alias of `topic` or `topics`.

```js
import { Voice } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = new Voice.Client({
  project: "<project-id>",
  token: "<api-token>",
  topics: ["office"],
});
```

# Fixes
- Fix the new zoomed Video layouts to be appropriately centered.
- Improvements to Detector for AMD detections.
