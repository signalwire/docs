## Added

- Support for `lock` and `unlock` on RoomSessions. This will allow the locking of the `RoomSession`
which will prevent new members from being able to join. Additionally, room previews are stopped
and replaced with a locked image. The `RoomSession` can be unlocked through the unlock method.

```js
const roomSession = new SignalWire.Video.RoomSession({
  token: "<YourRoomToken>",
  rootElement: document.getElementById("myVideoElement"),
});

// Short example that locks the room when a member joins and unlocks it when they leave.
roomSession.on("member.joined", (e) => {
  roomSession.lock();
});

roomSession.on("member.leave", (e) => {
  roomSession.unlock();
});
```

- Support for `nodeId`. Optional parameter for `dialSip` and `dialPhone` that allows you to direct your calls through a specified node. This can help with efficient geolocation routing.

```js
try {
  const call = await client.dialSip({
    from: "sip:xxx@yyy.zz",
    to: "sip:ppp@qqq.rr",
    timeout: 30,
    nodeId: "NODE ID HERE"
  });
} catch (e) {
  console.log("Call not answered.");
}
```
