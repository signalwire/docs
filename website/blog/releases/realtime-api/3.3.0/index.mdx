Today we are releasing version 3.3 of the Realtime SDK. It consists of a couple of improvements and fixes.

## Highlights

### Video Playback

We have exposed methods to `seek` a specific video position during playback. d308daf8
These include:

- `playback.seek(timecode)` seeks the current playback time to the specified absolute position.
```javascript
const playback = await roomSession.play({ url: "rtmp://example.com/foo" });
await playback.seek(30_000); // 30th second
```

- `playback.forward(offset)` seeks the current playback time forward by the specified offset.
```javascript
const playback = await roomSession.play({ url: "rtmp://example.com/foo" });
await playback.forward(5000); // 5 seconds
```

- `playback.rewind(offset)` seeks the current playback time backward by the specified offset.
```javascript
const playback = await roomSession.play({ url: "rtmp://example.com/foo" });
await playback.rewind(5000); // 5 seconds
```

Note that the boolean property `seekable` has been added to `RoomSessionPlayback` to support these methods.

## Improvements

- Removed the option to pass `volume` from methods of Voice.Playlist typings. 9eb9851f

## Fixes

- Fixed issue with missing `member.update` events. 8ec914b6
