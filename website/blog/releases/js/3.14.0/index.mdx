Today we are releasing version 3.14 of the JavaScript SDK. There are several improvements and fixes. Here are the highlights.

## Highlights

### `getAllowedChannels` in PubSub and Chat
The new method `getAllowedChannels` is available to PubSub and Chat namespaces. [d8cf078](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/d8cf078ca113286b77ee978ae6c9c891a5b9d634)

It returns the channels that the current token allows you to subscribe to as well as the permissions you have for each channel. The return is structured as an object whose keys are the channel names and whose values are the permissions. For example:

```js
{
  "channel-1": { "read": true, "write": false },
  "channel-2": { "read": true, "write": true },
}
```

### Methods to Manage Metadata
We have added several new methods to manage metadata in a Video room session.  [d7ce34d](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/d7ce34d3e0a54952321b3186abcbad3cd97b7f81)
- `roomSession.updateMeta` updates the room's metadata only in specified fields. This is different from the existing method `setMeta` which replaces the whole metadata object.
- `roomSession.deleteMeta` deletes specific keys from the metadata of the current room session.
- `roomSession.updateMemberMeta` updates a member's metadata only in specified fields. The existing method `setMemberMeta` replaces the whole metadata object.
- `roomSession.deleteMemberMeta` deletes specific keys from the metadata of the desired member.

These four methods work similarly. Let's look at `updateMeta` as an example.
```js
roomSession.on("room.updated", (e) => {
  // We can set an event listener to log changes to the metadata.
  console.log(e.room.meta);
});
await roomSession.setMeta({ foo: "bar", baz: true });
// The log will print { foo: "bar", baz: true },
await roomSession.updateMeta({ baz: false, t: 10 });
 // After the call to `updateMeta` our log will print { foo: "bar", baz: false, t: 10 }.
```

Note that for any of these methods, you must specify the `room.set_meta` permission when creating the Video Room Token.

## Other Improvements
- Updated  `RoomSession.getRecordings` and `RoomSession.getPlaybacks` to return stateful objects and deprecated  `RoomSession.recordings` in favour of the getter methods. [eb1c3fe](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/eb1c3fe985767f747747ca0525b1c0710af862cb)
- Changed handling of the auto managed `rootElement` to avoid mutating its styles. [24e956a](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/24e956a231a491c37b26cac775a3d4139a9bdace)
- Reviewed socket closed event handling to improve connection retries. [7bdd7ab](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/7bdd7ab03414a4b9aa337e9d6b339891c8feda36)

## Fixes
- When destroying the client, added a short delay to allow all of the sagas to complete their tasks.. [7b19610](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/7b196107f120db410c5f85a3fd20682bacbf7576)
