## Improvements
- New events keep track of the connected devices' status. [`e8141c0e`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/e8141c0e85e11477e2911e6eccb1e96cff860d58)

We have added `updated` and `disconnected` events for microphone, camera, and speaker devices. When listening for microphone update events with

```js
const roomSession = new Video.RoomSession({
  host: YOUR_HOST,
  token: YOUR_TOKEN,
  ...
})
roomSession.on('microphone.updated', (payload) => {
  console.debug('>> microphone.updated', payload)
});
roomSession.on('microphone.disconnected', (payload) => {
  console.debug('>> microphone.disconnected', payload)
});
```

you will receive the following event payload if a microphone is updated:

```js
{
  previous: {
    label: 'microphone array',
    deviceId: '35e85417-09cf-4b07-8f21-d3c16809e5a8'
  },
  current: {
    label: 'headset',
    deviceId: '4a829c9f-812c-49d7-b272-e3077213c55e'
  },
}
```

If the microphone is then disconnected, you will receive the following event:

```js
{
  label: 'headset',
  deviceId: '4a829c9f-812c-49d7-b272-e3077213c55e'
}
```
