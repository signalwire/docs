Today's JavaScript SDK release includes an improvement for Video and a small fix.

## Improvements

- The new method `setLocalStream` has been added to the Video `RoomSession` object to update the local media stream. [`aaa07479`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/aaa07479db10685e72d96ea43927d759dbac076e)

```js
const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
// Interact with the canvas
const stream = canvas.captureStream(25); // 25 FPS
await roomSession.setLocalStream(stream);
```

See the [technical reference](/sdks/browser-sdk/video/room-session#setlocalstream) for additional examples.

## Fixes

- Improved reconnection logic under bad network conditions. [`f3711f17`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/f3711f1726a9001a4204527b34b452de80e9a0e6)
