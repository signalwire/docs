Today we are releasing version 3.9 of the JavaScript SDK.

## Highlights

We have added a helper function for measuring the volume of the audio from the microphones. You can use this to allow the user to check that the devices are working properly. For example:

```js
const micAnalyzer = await createMicrophoneAnalyzer('device-id')

micAnalyzer.on('volumeChanged', (vol) => {
  console.log("Volume: ", vol)
})
micAnalyzer.on('destroyed', (reason) => {
  console.log('Microphone analyzer destroyed', reason)
})

micAnalyzer.destroy()
```

## New features

 - We now expose a `removeAllListeners` method from all our event-emitting objects.

## Fixes

 - We removed an obsolete console warning which was triggered for the previously experimental Chat feature.
