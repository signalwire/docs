## Improvements

- Initial changes to set up a global `SignalWire` client. [`65b0eea5`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/65b0eea54346b177e94fd3960e8cc21579c8a9ce) This will allow users to access Call Fabric to create calls outside of a namespace as they currently do with a `Voice.Client` or `Video.Client`.
- Added a user-defined refresh token function called `onRefreshToken` to update an access token. [`b44bd6fb`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/b44bd6fbd69acd206e43b5b1fefbe7989dc16298) This is a method on the `SignalWire` client mentioned above.

```js
client = await SignalWire({
      host: document.getElementById('host').value,
      token: document.getElementById('token').value,
      rootElement: document.getElementById('rootElement'),
      onRefreshToken: async () => {
        // Fetch the new token and update the client
        const newToken = await fetch('/foo')
        await client.updateToken(newToken)
      },
    })
```

When the access token is expiring, `onRefreshToken` will be called to fetch and set a new token without interruption to the client's operation.
