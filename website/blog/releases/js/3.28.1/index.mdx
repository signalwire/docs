## Summary

This release introduces **Call Fabric** and **Video SDK** enhancements, including new APIs for room management, 
media renegotiation, member overlays, chat messaging, user hand raising, and more. In the Call Fabric interface, several
types and interfaces have been refined or added for better clarity, and default call behavior is now audio-only for a 
more optimized initial setup. Additionally, we've introduced convenient methods for sorting addresses, reattaching calls,
and handling conversations. Numerous fixes address type inconsistencies, event handling, and memory leaks, 
ensuring a more stable and efficient development experience.

## Added

### 1. Lock/Unlock Methods

New `lock` and `unlock` methods on `FabricRoomSession` to restrict and restore entry to a specific room.

```ts
await call.lock()
await call.unlock()
```

### 2. Set Member Position API

Allows you to move a member to a specific position within the room layout.

```ts
await roomSession.setPositions({ positions: { self: "standard-2" }})
```

### 3. Member Overlays

Expose overlays on top of video elements for each member to display additional member information or custom UI for the Call Fabric and Video SDK.

### 4. Raise/Lower Hand

Call Fabric SDK now supports raising and lowering the participant's hand.

```ts
await roomSession.setRaisedHand({ raised: true })
await roomSession.setRaisedHand({ raised: false })
```

### 5. Chat Namespace in Call Fabric

New chat methods to handle sending and receiving chat messages within a room or call context.

```ts
const messages = await client.chat.getMessages({ addressId: 'id' })
const sub = await client.chat.subscribe({ addressId: 'id', onMessage: console.log })
await client.chat.sendMessage({ addressId: 'id', text: 'hello' })
```

### 6. Reattach Method

A new `reattach` method has been introduced for the Call Fabric client to reattach a call without starting from scratch.

```ts
const call = await client.reattach({
  to: `/public/${roomName}`,
  rootElement: document.getElementById('rootElement'),
})
```

### 7. Expose Room Layout

The `FabricRoomSession` object now provides direct access to the current room layout.

```ts
const call = await client.dial({ ... })
await call.start()
call.currentLayout;
```

### 8. Sort Parameters on Addresses

You can now use `sort` parameters when fetching addresses on the server side for more organized data retrieval.

```ts
const response = await client.address.getAddresses({
  type: 'room',
  sortBy: 'name',
  sortOrder: 'desc',
  pageSize: 3,
})
```

### 9. User Variables Param

Added a `userVariables` parameter to both `DialOption` and `SignalWireClientParams` to send additional metadata.

```ts
const call = await SignalWire({
  ...params,
  userVariables: { name: 'Jane Doe', email: 'john.doe@gmail.com' },
})

// Or
const call = await client.dial({
  ...params,
  userVariables: { name: 'Jane Doe', email: 'john.doe@gmail.com' },
})
```

### 10. New Media APIs with Renegotiation

Dynamically set or change the audio/video direction (`sendonly`, `recvonly`, `sendrecv`, `inactive`) and apply new `MediaTrackConstraints` during an active session.

```ts
await updateMedia({
  audio: {
    enable: true,
    direction: 'send' | 'sendrecv',
    constraints?: MediaTrackConstraints
  },
  video: {
    enable: false,
    direction: 'none' | 'receive'
  }
})

await setVideoDirection('send' | 'sendrecv' | 'none' | 'receive')
await setAudioDirection('send' | 'sendrecv' | 'none' | 'receive')
```

### 11. Screen Share Feature

Screen sharing is now baked into the Call Fabric SDK for simpler real-time collaboration.

```ts
const screenShare = await call 
    .startScreenShare({
      audio: true,
      video: true,
      ...opts,
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('ScreenShare Error', error)
    })

await screenShare.hangup()
```

### 12. Conversations Join API

Seamlessly join existing conversations in the CF SDK.

```ts
await client.conversation.join({
  addressId: id,
})
```

### 13. Fetch Address by Name

New `name` parameter to `client.address.getAddress` for retrieving addresses using their name.

```ts
const addressByName = await client.address.getAddress({ name: "john doe" })
```

## Changed

### 1. Remove Implicit Re-authentication

Call Fabric SDK no longer tries to automatically reauthenticate, giving you full control over session auth flow.

The `onRefreshToken` is no longer available for the CF SDK that performed the implicit re-authentication.

With the new changes, the application needs to call the `updateToken` function to perform the explicit re-authentication.

```ts
await client.updateToken('newToken');
```

### 2. Default Audio-Only
Dialing a Call Fabric room (e.g. `client.dial()`) defaults to audio-only unless otherwise specified.

```ts
const call = await client.dial({address: `/public/${roomName}`}) // now defaults to audio-only
const call = await client.dial({address: `/public/${roomName}?channel=video`}) // use channel parameter to explicitly request video
```

### 3. User Params Priority for `client.dial`
User-defined parameters (e.g., `audio`, `video`, `negotiateAudio`, `negotiateVideo`) now override or get higher priority than the channel specified in the resource address when dialing a call with `client.dial`.

### 4. Screen Share Error Handling
`Call.startScreenShare()` now throws an error if the user denies screen sharing permission.

### 5. Internal Video Layout Layer
The `InternalVideoLayoutLayer` interface type is now publicly exposed.

### 6. Enumerate Devices by Kind
Browser SDKs can now leverage a more specialized `enumerateDevicesByKind` method for microphone, camera, and more.

```ts
import { enumerateDevicesByKind } from '@signalwire/js'
const devices = await enumerateDevicesByKind('videoinput') // "videoinput", "audioinput" or "audiooutput"
```

### 7. Expose FabricRoomSession Type
Types for `FabricRoomSession` are now exported for easier type-checking and integration.

### 8. Address ID in Conversation
The CF SDK `ConversationContract` now exposes the `addressId` for more direct resource referencing

### 9. Negotiate Audio/Video
You can set the audio/video negotiation parameters to better control media usage while dialing a call.

```ts
const call = await client.dial({
  address: `/public/room`,
  negotiateAudio: true,
  negotiateVideo: false,
})
```

### 10. Updated Conversation/Address Schemas
New properties were added to `ConversationMessage`, `GetAddressResponse`, and `GetSubscriberInfoResponse` interfaces for expanded functionality.

### 11. Unsubscribe from Conversations
CF SDK allows unsubscribing from conversation updates, giving you more fine-grained control over event listening.

```ts
const { unsubscribe } = await client.conversation.subscribe(() => { /* ... */ })
unsubscribe();
```

### 12. Dedicated Types for Video and Fabric SDKs
Clear separation of types for each SDK to reduce confusion and potential collisions. The Video SDK and the Call Fabric SDK are now distinct types.
For example, `FabricRoomSession` and `VideoRoomSession` are now distinct types which both derive from `BaseRoomSession`.

## Fixed

1. New types have been added and incorrect type definitions have been fixed:
    - `ConversationMessageEventParams.type` is now `string` instead of `MessageType`
    - `ConversationContract` has been added
    - Types for `VideoLayout` and other layout related types fixed 
2. Chat Messages filtering for previous and next pages have been fixed
3. The `getAddress` method now returns a normalized response
4. Local `audio_muted` and `video_muted` state for `Call` will now reflect the actual state
5. Typos in type names have been fixed for `ConversationChatMessagesSubscribeParams` and `ConversationChatMessagesSubscribeResult`
