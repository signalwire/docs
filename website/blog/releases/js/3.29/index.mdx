## Summary

This release improves the websocket connection and stability significantly. 
It also focuses on **microphone controls**, **participant management**, and **Call Fabric SDK enhancements**. 
Key additions include new microphone control features (auto gain, echo cancellation, noise suppression), 
the ability to mute/unmute all participants simultaneously, and improved Call Fabric SDK functionality with 
`fromFabricAddressId` parameter support and configurable default media parameters. Additionally, this release 
fixes critical issues with push notifications, improves WebSocket reconnection handling, and resolves 
various type interface inconsistencies for a more stable development experience.

## Added

### 1. Microphone controls for self and other members

Added support for microphone control features including auto gain, echo cancellation, and noise suppression.

**New FabricMemberContract controls:**
- `member.auto_gain`
- `member.echo_cancellation`
- `member.noise_suppression`

**New function support:**

```ts
await FabricRoomSession.setAudioFlags({
  autoGain: false,
  echoCancellation: false,
  noiseSuppression: false,
});
```

### 2. Mute/unmute controls for all participants

Added support for muting and unmuting audio and video for all participants in both audio-only and video calls.

```ts
// Mute all members' audio
await FabricRoomSession.audioMute({ memberId: "all" });

// Unmute all members' audio
await FabricRoomSession.audioUnmute({ memberId: "all" });

// Mute all members' video
await FabricRoomSession.videoMute({ memberId: "all" });

// Unmute all members' video
await FabricRoomSession.videoUnmute({ memberId: "all" });
```

### 3. CF SDK: Support for `fromFabricAddressId` parameter

Added the ability to pass `fromFabricAddressId` when dialing.

```ts
const call = await SignalWireClient.dial({
  // ... other parameters
  to: "...",
  fromFabricAddressId: "valid_subscriber_id", // Optional
  // ... other parameters
});
```

### 4. CF SDK: Default media parameters

Added support for configuring default media parameters during call setup.

```ts
await call.dial({
  applyLocalVideoOverlay: false, // Should the SDK apply local video overlay? Default: true
  applyMemberOverlay: true, // Should the SDK apply member video overlays? Default: true
  stopCameraWhileMuted: true, // Should the SDK stop the camera when muted? Default: true
  stopMicrophoneWhileMuted: true, // Should the SDK stop the mic when muted? Default: true
  mirrorLocalVideoOverlay: false, // Should the SDK mirror the local video overlay? Default: true
});
```


## Fixed

### 1. Handle push notifications without enabling websocket connection

Added an optional `handlePushNotification` method to allow developers to receive push notifications without being online via websocket.

```ts
SignalWireContract.handlePushNotification(params: HandlePushNotificationParams)
```

Previously, receiving push notifications required calling `SignalWireContract.online()` which automatically made you online on websocket as well.
If user is online from both websocket and push notification simultaneously, the call would hang up because the server couldn't
distinguish that both notification endpoints belonged to the same device.

### 2. CF SDK: Raise hand functionality

Fixed raise hand call and member capability issues.

### 3. Pagination interfaces

Exposed pagination interfaces for better type safety:
- `PaginatedResponse`
- `PaginatedResult`

### 4. WebSocket reconnection improvements

Improved WebSocket reconnections and re-subscription to voice call topics after socket reconnects.

### 5. Type interface fixes

Fixed type interfaces for `getMessages` and `getMembers` methods.
