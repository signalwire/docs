Version 3.19 of the JavaScript SDK introduces a new feature for Video: Interactive Live Streaming. Here are the highlights.

## Interactive Live Streaming

Interactive Live Streaming is a Video product that provides a flexible middle ground between RTMP streaming
and a Video conference. RTMP streaming allows users to stream their audio and video to a passive audience,
while a video conference allows all users to transmit and receive audio and video.
Interactive Live Streaming allows users to experience either state or switch between them in one
Video room, depending on their role.

## Join a Video Room as `member` or `audience`

As always, the JavaScript SDK `join()` method will join a Video room. Whether a user joins as `member`
or `audience` depends on the room token passed. In the API, The `join_as()` parameter has been added to the
Video Room Token request to give users `member` or `audience` permissions. A `member` will **transmit and receive**
audio and video. An `audience` participant will only **receive** audio and video.

```shell
curl -L -X POST "https://$SPACE_URL/api/video/room_tokens" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -u "$PROJECT_ID:$API_TOKEN" \
  --data-raw '{
    "room_name": "my_room",
    "user_name": "John Smith",
    "join_as": "audience"
  }'
```

```js
import * as SignalWire from '@signalwire/js'

const roomSession = new SignalWire.Video.RoomSession({
  token: "<YourRoomToken>",
  rootElement: document.getElementById("yourVideoElement"),
});

roomSession.join();
```

## Read the Current Participant's Interactivity Mode

The new property `interactivityMode` is available on the `RoomSession` object to read the local member's current
interactivity mode (`member` or `audience`).

## Promote Audience or Demote Members
To change the interactivity mode of a participant, the methods `promote()` and `demote()`
have been added to the `RoomSession` object.

`promote` requires the audience participant's ID, and you may choose to set specific Video Room permissions.

```js
await roomSession.promote({
  memberId: "de550c0c-3fac-4efd-b06f-b5b8614b8966",
  mediaAllowed: "all",
  permissions: [
    "room.self.audio_mute",
    "room.self.audio_unmute",
    "room.self.video_mute",
    "room.self.video_unmute",
    "room.list_available_layouts",
  ],
});
```

Optional parameters on `promote` include `meta`, `joinAudioMuted`, and `joinVideoMuted`.
[bc56cc4](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-js/commit/bc56cc42497220d43085adea8f3834fbce60444b)

See the [`promote` technical reference](https://developer.signalwire.com/sdks/reference/browser-sdk/video/video-roomsession#promote)
for a complete list of parameters.

`demote` removes the participant's ability to send audio and video.
[Technical reference](https://developer.signalwire.com/sdks/reference/browser-sdk/video/video-roomsession#demote)

```js
await roomSession.demote({
  memberId: "de550c0c-3fac-4efd-b06f-b5b8614b8966",
  mediaAllowed: "all",
});
```

## Events to Support Interactive Live Streaming
`member.promoted` `member.demoted` and `room.audience_count` events are available on the
`RoomSession` object to track members and audience changes.
