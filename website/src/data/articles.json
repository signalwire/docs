This allows SignalWire to query your web application in order for instructions on what to do next. For example, you might use a webhook to handle an inbound call by reading the instructions in your webhook to play an IVR, route the customer to the right department, and connect them with an agent. You could also use a webhook as a status callback where each status change of a call or message is sent to your web application which might store some instructions for handling emergent errors.",
