- `defaultOpen` (optional): Whether the accordion is initially expanded (default: false)
- `icon` (optional): React node to display as an icon on the left
- `onChange` (optional): Callback function triggered when accordion state changes
- `children` (required): Content to show when accordion is expanded

### AccordionGroup Props

- `children` (required): Collection of Accordion components to group together

## Example

<Accordion title="Wingardium Leviosa" icon={<FaFly/>}>
  A charm used to make objects fly. It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa!

    #include <iostream>
    int main() {
        levioso();
    }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Expecto Patronum" description="Make the dementors go away">
  The Patronus Charm is one of the most powerful defensive charms known to wizardkind. The spell conjures a magical guardian, a projection of all your most positive feelings.
</Accordion>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Polyjuice Potion" description="Complex transformation brew">
    A complicated potion that allows the drinker to assume the appearance of another person. Brewing time: 1 month. Key ingredients include lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and a piece of the person you want to turn into.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Felix Felicis">
