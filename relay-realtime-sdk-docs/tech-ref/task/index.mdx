```js
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here"})

const taskClient = client.task

await taskClient.listen({
  topics: ['office'],
  onTaskReceived: (payload) => {
    console.log('Received task', payload)
  }
});
```
