## Relay.Calling.DetectAction

This object returned from one of the _asynchronous_ detect methods that represents a running detector on the call.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `result` | [`Relay.Calling.DetectResult`][relay-calling-detectresult] | Final detector result. |
| `completed` | `boolean` | Whether the action has finished. |
| `payload` | `dict` | Payload sent to Relay to start this detector. |
| `control_id` | `string` | UUID to identify the detector. |

### Methods

#### stop

Stop the action immediately.

**Parameters**

_None_

**Returns**

`coroutine` - Coroutine that will return a [`Relay.Calling.StopResult`][relay-calling-stopresult] object.

**Examples**

Trying to detect a machine and stop the action after 5 seconds:

```python
import asyncio # to use sleep

action = await call.detect_answering_machine_async()
# For demonstration purposes only..
await asyncio.sleep(5)
await action.stop()
```
