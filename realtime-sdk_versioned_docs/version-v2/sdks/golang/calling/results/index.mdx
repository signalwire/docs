## Common Result Properties

Most results share common properties:

### successful

Returns `true` if the operation was successful, `false` otherwise.

### event

Returns the last Relay Event that arrived for this operation.

## Error Handling

Always check the `Successful` property and handle errors appropriately:

```go
result, err := call.PlayAudio("https://example.com/audio.mp3")
if err != nil {
    // Handle the error
    log.Printf("Error: %v", err)
    return
}

if !result.Successful {
    // Handle unsuccessful result
    log.Printf("Play operation failed")
    return
}

// Operation was successful
log.Printf("Audio played successfully")
```
