A Relay Consumer is a simple object that runs in its own process along side your application to handle calling and messaging events in realtime. Relay Consumers abstract all the setup of connecting to Relay and automatically dispatch workers to handle requests. Consumers will receive requests and delegate them to their own worker thread, allowing you to focus on your business logic without having to worry about multi-threading or blocking, everything just works. Think of Relay Consumers like a background worker system for all your calling and messaging needs.

## Authenticating a consumer

Authentication requires a SignalWire project ID and a token. You can generate one from your dashboard.

The values can be passed in either as the `project` and `token` parameters to the constructor, or by setting the `SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT_KEY` and `SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN` environment variables.

An example using constructor parameters:

```ruby
class MyConsumer < Signalwire::Relay::Consumer
  contexts ['incoming']

  def on_incoming_call(call)
    call.answer
    call.play_tts 'this consumer uses constructor parameters'

    call.hangup
  end
end

MyConsumer.new(project: 'your-project-key', token: 'your-project-token').run
```

## Consumer Contexts

A Relay Consumer is a simple object, customized by specifying contexts and event handlers to respond to incoming events.

A consumer usually requires at least one `contexts` for incoming events. Contexts are a list of contexts you want this Consumer to listen for. [Learn more about Contexts][index].

```ruby
class MyConsumer < Signalwire::Relay::Consumer
  contexts ['incoming']

  def on_incoming_call(call)
    call.answer
    call.play_tts 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'

    call.hangup
  end
end

MyConsumer.new.run
```

## Initializing Consumers

You can optionally define a `setup` method if you need to do any initialization work before processing messages. This is useful to do any one-off work that you wouldn't want to do for each and every event, such as setting up logging or connecting to a datastore.

```ruby
class MyConsumer < Signalwire::Relay::Consumer
  contexts ['incoming']

  def setup
    SomeDatabase.connect
  end

  def on_incoming_call(call)
    call.answer
    call.play_tts 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'

    call.hangup
  end
end

MyConsumer.new.run
```

## Event Handlers

Event handlers are where you will write most of your code. They are executed when your consumer receives a matching event for the contexts specified by your Consumer.

### on_incoming_call

Executed when you receive an inbound call, passes in the inbound [`Call`][call] object.

```ruby
class MyConsumer < Signalwire::Relay::Consumer
  contexts ['incoming']

  def on_incoming_call(call)
    call.answer
    call.play_tts 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'

    call.hangup
  end
end

MyConsumer.new.run
```

### ready

This method is executed when the Consumer has connected and is ready to make Relay requests.

```ruby
require 'signalwire'

class MyConsumer < Signalwire::Relay::Consumer
  def ready
    logger.debug "The consumer is ready to execute actions now"
    # Send an SMS on ready
    result = client.messaging.send(from: "+1XXXXXXXXXX", to: "+1YYYYYYYYYY", context: 'incoming', body: 'Hello from SignalWire!')
    logger.debug "message id #{result.message_id} was successfully sent" if result.successful
  end
end

MyConsumer.new.run
```

### on_task

Receives your message sent through a [`Relay::Task`][relay-task].

```ruby
require 'signalwire'

class MyConsumer < Signalwire::Relay::Consumer
  contexts ['incoming']

  def on_task(task)
    logger.debug "Received #{task.message}"
  end
end

MyConsumer.new.run
```

### on_incoming_message

This method is executed when the consumer receives an inbound text message on one of the subscribed contexts. Receives a [`Message`][message-1] object as a parameter.

```ruby
class MessageReceiveConsumer < Signalwire::Relay::Consumer
  contexts ['office']

  def on_incoming_message(message)
    logger.info "Received message from #{message.from}: #{message.body}"
  end
end

MessageReceiveConsumer.new.run
```

### on_message_state_change

Executed when a message state changes in a context the consumer is subscribed to. Receives a [`Message`][message-1] object as a parameter.

```ruby
class MessageSendConsumer < Signalwire::Relay::Consumer
  def on_message_state_change(message)
    logger.debug "message id #{message.id} now has state #{message.state}"
  end
end

MessageSendConsumer.new.run
```

## Cleaning Up on Exit

When a Relay Consumer shuts down, you have the opportunity to clean up any resources held by the consumer. For example, you could close any open files, network connections, or send a notification to your monitoring service.

Just implement a `teardown` method in your consumer and it will be called during the shutdown procedure.

```ruby
class MyConsumer < Signalwire::Relay::Consumer
  contexts ['incoming']

  def teardown
    SomeDatabase.disconnect
  end

  def on_incoming_call(call)
    call.answer
    call.play_tts 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'

    call.hangup
  end
end

MyConsumer.new.run
```

## Running Consumers

Running a consumer is just like running any Ruby script, simply execute the script as a separate process and call `run` to start it. The process will stay up until you shut it down.

## Shutting Down Consumers

In order to gracefully shut down a Relay consumer process, send it the `SIGTERM` signal. Most process supervisors such as Runit, Docker and Kubernetes send this signal when shutting down a process.
