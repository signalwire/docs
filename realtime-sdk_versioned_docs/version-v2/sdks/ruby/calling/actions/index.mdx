# Calling Actions

Action objects represent asynchronous operations that are currently active on a call. These objects provide methods to control and interact with ongoing operations like playing audio, recording, detecting events, and more.

## Available Actions

- [**ConnectAction**][connectaction] - Represents an active connection attempt on a call
- [**DetectAction**][detectaction] - Represents a running detector (like machine detection) on a call
- [**FaxAction**][faxaction] - Represents an active fax send or receive operation
- [**PlayAction**][playaction] - Represents active audio playback on a call
- [**PromptAction**][promptaction] - Represents an active prompt (play + collect) operation
- [**RecordAction**][recordaction] - Represents an active recording on a call
- [**SendDigitsAction**][senddigitsaction] - Represents an active send digits operation
- [**TapAction**][tapaction] - Represents an active media tap on a call

## Common Properties

All action objects share some common properties:

- `completed` - Boolean indicating whether the action has finished
- `result` - The final result object (available once completed)
- `payload` - The original payload sent to start the action

## Common Methods

Most action objects provide a `stop` method to immediately terminate the action:

```ruby
action = call.play_audio('https://example.com/audio.mp3')
# ... later
action.stop
```
