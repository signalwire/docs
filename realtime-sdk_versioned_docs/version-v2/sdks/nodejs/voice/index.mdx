# Voice API

The Voice API provides functionality for making and receiving phone calls. This section covers the legacy v2 Voice API implementation.

## Overview

The Voice API allows you to:
- Make outbound calls
- Receive inbound calls
- Control call flow and state
- Play audio and text-to-speech
- Record calls
- Handle call events

## Getting Started

To use the Voice API, you'll need to configure your Relay client and handle voice events through the calling interface.
