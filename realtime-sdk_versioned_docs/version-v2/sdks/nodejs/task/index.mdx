# Relay.Task

A `Relay.Task` is simple way to send jobs to your [`Relay.Consumers`][relay-consumers] from a short lived process, like a web framework. Relay Tasks allow you to pass commands down to your Consumers without blocking your short lived request. Think of a Relay Task as a way to queue a job for your background workers to processes asynchronously.

## Creating Tasks

A Task is a simple object with 2 required arguments: `project` and `token`. Project and Token are used to send the Task to your Consumers. Once created, the Task has only one method `deliver` to send jobs to your Consumer.

```javascript
const { Task } = require('@signalwire/node')

const yourTask = new Task('XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX', 'PTXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX')
const context = 'office'
yourTask.deliver(context, { 'key': 'value', 'data': 'data for your job' })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Task created successfully!')
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log('Error creating task!', error)
  })
```

## Methods

### deliver

Send a job to your `Consumer` in a specific context.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `context` | `string` | **required** | Context where to send the Task |
| `message` | `object` | **required** | Object with your custom data that will be sent to your Consumer's [`onTask`][relay-consumers] handler |

#### Returns

`Promise` - Promise resolved in case of success, rejected otherwise.

#### Examples

> Deliver a task to your Consumer with a message to then make an outbound Call.

```javascript
const message = {
  'action': 'call',
  'from': '+18881112222'
  'to': '+18881113333'
}
task.deliver('office', message).then(() => {
  console.log('Task created successfully!')
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.log('Error creating task!', error)
})
```
