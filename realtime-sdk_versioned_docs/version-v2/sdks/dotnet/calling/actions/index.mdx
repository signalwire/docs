# Actions Overview

Actions in the SignalWire Relay SDK for .NET represent asynchronous operations that can be performed on calls. Each action returns immediately and provides methods to control and monitor the operation.

# Available Actions

- [**Connect**][connect] - Connect a call to another endpoint
- [**Detect**][detect] - Detect tones, speech, or answering machines
- [**Fax**][fax] - Send or receive fax transmissions
- [**Play**][play] - Play audio, TTS, or silence
- [**Prompt**][prompt] - Collect user input with prompts
- [**Record**][record] - Record call audio
- [**Send Digits**][send-digits] - Send DTMF tones
- [**Tap**][tap] - Tap call audio for real-time streaming

# Common Action Properties

All actions share common properties for monitoring and control:

- `Completed` - Whether the action has finished
- `Result` - The result object containing outcome details
- `Successful` - Whether the action completed successfully

# Async Pattern

Actions follow the async pattern where the method returns immediately with an action object that can be monitored:

```csharp
PlayAction action = call.PlayAsync(media);

// Do other work while action executes

// Check if completed
if (action.Completed && action.Successful) {
    // Action finished successfully
}
```
