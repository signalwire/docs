# Examples

Follow the examples to see how's easy to use the Relay SDK to interact with inbound or outbound calls.

### Outbound Calls

> Using a Relay Consumer to make an outbound call and say "Welcome to SignalWire!", then hangup.

```python
import logging
from signalwire.relay.consumer import Consumer

class CustomConsumer(Consumer):
  def setup(self):
    self.project = 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX'
    self.token = 'PTXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    self.contexts = ['office']

  async def ready(self):
    logging.info('CustomConsumer is ready!')
    # Replace numbers with yours!
    dial_result = await self.client.calling.dial(to_number='+18991114443', from_number='+18991114444')
    if dial_result.successful is False:
      logging.info('Outbound call not answered or failed')
      return
    # Take the Call object from "dial_result"
    call = dial_result.call
    await call.play_tts(text='Welcome to SignalWire!')
    logging.info('Hanging up..')
    await call.hangup()

consumer = CustomConsumer()
consumer.run()
```

### Connect inbound calls with a series of devices

> Using a Relay Consumer to manage inbound calls from the `office` context. Answer the call, try to connect it with 3 devices and wait until the remote call will be hanged up.

```python
from signalwire.relay.consumer import Consumer

class CustomConsumer(Consumer):
  def setup(self):
    self.project = 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX'
    self.token = 'PTXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    self.contexts = ['office']
    self.devices = [
      { 'to_number': '+18991114443' },
      { 'to_number': '+18991114444' },
      { 'to_number': '+18991114445' }
    ]

  async def on_incoming_call(self, call):
    result = await call.answer()
    if result.successful is False:
      print('Error answering the call')
      return
    result = await call.connect(device_list=self.devices)
    if result.successful:
      remote_call = result.call
      # Wait until the remote leg is ended..
      await remote_call.wait_for_ended()
    await call.hangup()

consumer = CustomConsumer()
consumer.run()
```

### Send an SMS

> Using a Relay Consumer to send SMS.

```python
import logging
from signalwire.relay.consumer import Consumer

class CustomConsumer(Consumer):
  def setup(self):
    self.project = 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX'
    self.token = 'PTXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    self.contexts = ['office']

  async def ready(self):
    logging.info('CustomConsumer is ready!')
    # Replace numbers with yours!
    result = await self.client.messaging.send(context='office', to_number='+18991114443', from_number='+18991114444', body='Welcome to SignalWire!')
    if result.successful:
      logging.info(f'Message sent. ID: {result.message_id}')

consumer = CustomConsumer()
consumer.run()
```
