Calling actions in the PHP Relay SDK v2 provide asynchronous control over calling operations. These action objects are returned from asynchronous methods and allow you to monitor, control, and interact with ongoing operations.

## Available Actions

- [Connect Action][connect-action] - Control active connection attempts
- [Detect Action][detect-action] - Control active detection operations  
- [Fax Action][fax-action] - Control active fax operations
- [Play Action][play-action] - Control active playback operations
- [Prompt Action][prompt-action] - Control active prompt/collect operations
- [Record Action][record-action] - Control active recording operations
- [Send Digits Action][send-digits-action] - Control active digit sending operations
- [Tap Action][tap-action] - Control active media tapping operations

## Common Methods

All action objects share common methods:

- `getResult()` - Get the final result when the action completes
- `getState()` - Get the current state of the action
- `getPayload()` - Get the original payload sent to Relay
- `isCompleted()` - Check if the action has finished
- `stop()` - Stop the ongoing action (where applicable)

For detailed documentation of each action class, please refer to the full [PHP SDK documentation][php-sdk-documentation].
