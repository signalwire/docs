Calling results in the PHP Relay SDK v2 contain the outcome of calling operations. These result objects are returned when operations complete and provide detailed information about what happened.

## Available Results

- [Answer Result][answer-result] - Result of answering a call
- [Connect Result][connect-result] - Result of connecting calls
- [Detect Result][detect-result] - Result of detection operations
- [Dial Result][dial-result] - Result of dialing operations
- [Fax Result][fax-result] - Result of fax operations
- [Hangup Result][hangup-result] - Result of hanging up calls
- [Play Result][play-result] - Result of playback operations
- [Prompt Result][prompt-result] - Result of prompt/collect operations
- [Record Result][record-result] - Result of recording operations
- [Send Digits Result][send-digits-result] - Result of digit sending operations
- [Tap Result][tap-result] - Result of media tapping operations

## Common Methods

Most result objects share common methods:

- `isSuccessful()` - Check if the operation completed successfully
- `getEvent()` - Get the underlying Relay event that triggered this result

Each result object also provides specific methods relevant to its operation type (e.g., `getCall()` for dial results, `getUrl()` for record results).

For detailed documentation of each result class, please refer to the full [PHP SDK documentation][php-sdk-documentation].
