/*
* Many REST API endpoint sidebars have items that are autogenerated using the `docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs` plugin.
* These autogenerated sidebars are created in the output directory specified in the plugin configuration.
* The configuration field for this is `outputDir`.
* 
* Example: outputDir: "docs/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints".
* 
* We then import these autogenerated sidebars here and add them to the sidebar items array.
* This process is repeated for each REST API endpoint sidebar.
* 
* Example: require("../../docs/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints/sidebar")
