# GuidesList and GuidesListMirror

:::warning

`<GuidesList>` and `<GuidesListMirror>` don't work outside of the docs plugin, so there
is can't be a demo on this page (this is the pages plugin). 

:::

Either use `<GuidesList/>` on the docs page, or use `<GuidesList items={...}>`.

If you want to mirror a `<GuidesList/>` in other places, use `<GuidesListMirror href="slug">`.

To supply metadata, write frontmatter in the following structure:

```
---
title: PAGE TITLE
slug: /.../...
description: The description you want to appear (higher priority)
sidebar_custom_props:
  description: The description you want to appear (lower priority)
  platform: javascript
---
```
