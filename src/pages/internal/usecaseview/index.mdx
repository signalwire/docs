# UseCaseView component

<Subtitle>A way to demonstrate multiple use cases in multiple languages at once.</Subtitle>

---

The `<UseCaseView/>` component is an opinionated way of displaying multiple use-case code for a product (voice, SWML) etc.

On a large display, it shows multiple buttons to allow users to select use cases and specific products which support that
use case. 

On a small (mobile) display, it is a simple carousel with **Next** and **Prev** buttons, and a full-width code example.


---

## Try it out

import UseCases from "./usecases/_usecases.mdx"

<UseCases/>

### Demo (mobile)

import UseCasesMobileOnly from "./usecases/_usecasesmobile.mdx"

<UseCasesMobileOnly/>

## Reference code:

:::warning Please use multiple files.
Trying to fit all use cases and all paradigms into a single file will get very hard to maintain (and probably
hard to look at). So use one file per code example, in it's own separate folder.
:::

:::warning All partial files should start with an underscore (_) to avoid being mistaken for doc pages
Docusaurus ignores `.mdx` files starting with an underscore when generating sidebar and enumerating files, so 
`_usecases.mdx` won't be directly listed, but can still be included.
:::

import ReferenceCode from "./_reference_code.mdx"

<ReferenceCode/>


## Additional params

```jsx

// To force desktop mode, you can use:

<UseCaseView data={data} desktopMode/>

// To force mobile mode, you can use:

<UseCaseView data={data} mobileMode/>

// By default, both desktopMode and mobileMode are enabled, so it's responsive to changes

<UseCaseView data={data} desktopMode mobileMode/> // is the same as
<UseCaseView data={data} /> 

<UseCaseView data={data} /> 

// Don't force desktop or mobile mode unless you have strong reason to.
