## How it works

SignalWire's newest AI demo showcases a room service management tool, **RoomieServe AI**, 
developed using SignalWire's [AI Agent](/ai/get-started).
RoomieServe is designed for use in hotels and hospitals to improve the efficiency and accuracy of room 
service orders, showcasing another of the many diverse applications of this powerful AI innovation.

This AI solution is built on SignalWire's cutting-edge **AI Agent** technology. By putting an AI Agent
to work handling room service orders in spoken language, RoomieServe shows how the SignalWire AI Gateway
and AI Agent can improve efficiency and reliability in previously manual and resource-intensive operations.

### Dynamic Database Integration

RoomieServe AI is designed to **automatically update the interaction prompt** according to the menu inventory
database. This dynamic integration allows RoomieServe to act as a fully autonomous Room Service Manager,
offering customers the most current menu items based on their SKU (Stock Keeping Unit).

This feature keeps RoomieServe 100% up to date with inventory, facilitating a seamless ordering experience 
for guests and patients without manual intervention.

As configured, RoomieServe streamlines the ordering process by providing specific item pricing upon request.
This demonstrates the power and flexibility of AI Agents in balancing convenience with user-friendliness.

## Understanding Roomie's Capabilities

<br/>

RoomieServe structures data efficiently using **metadata tables** in the AI Agent to avoid SQL latnecy. Every piece of information 
used by the app is systematically stored within these tables, from menu specifics to SKUs
and pricing.

Shopping cart functionality is also integrated in the metadata framework, serving as a temporary data repository
while the AI Agent is active. This innovative approach drastically reduces the need for direct
database interactions, significantly enhancing response times and the smoothness of interactions with the AI.

By capitalizing on SignalWire's AI Agent technology, RoomieServe AI not only demonstrates
the immense potential of metadata in AI-driven applications but also elevates the standard
of room service. This blend of SignalWire's technology with advanced metadata management exemplifies
a forward-thinking strategy in enhancing guest and patient service, making RoomieServe AI a
pioneering solution in the realm of AI-assisted room service ordering.

## Try it out

### 1. Setup a company table

Get started by creating a table named `roomie_company` with fields for company ID, creation timestamp, name, contact number, and email. 
We then insert a record for a company named *'Chateau AI-luxe'* with its contact details. 
The `id` field auto-increments, and `created` automatically records the current timestamp.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS roomie_company (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    created TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    number VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO roomie_company (name, number, email) VALUES ('Chateau AI-luxe', '+100000000', 'roomserve@example.com');
```

---

### 2. Create a menu

The following SQL code snippet first checks if a custom enum type `meal_type` exists and creates it if not, 
including values for different meal categories. 

It then creates a `roomie_menu` table with details including 
  ID, 
  timestamp, 
  company ID, 
  SKU, 
  price, 
  description, 
  and category, 
linking to `roomie_company` via a foreign key. 
Lastly, our SQL inserts multiple records into roomie_menu, detailing various menu items including their company association, names, descriptions, SKUs, prices, and categories.

```sql
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM pg_type WHERE typname = 'item_type'
    ) THEN
        CREATE TYPE item_type AS ENUM ('Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', 'Beverage');
    END IF;
END$$;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS roomie_menu (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    created TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    roomie_company_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    sku VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    price NUMERIC DEFAULT 0.00,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    category item_type,
    FOREIGN KEY (roomie_company_id) REFERENCES roomie_company(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

INSERT INTO roomie_menu (roomie_company_id, name, description, sku, price, category) VALUES
(1, 'French Toast', 'Classic French Toast served with maple syrup and fresh berries.', 'CFT001', 15, 'Breakfast'),
(1, 'Avocado Toast', 'Multigrain bread topped with smashed avocado, poached egg, and a sprinkle of chili flakes.', 'AVT002', 12, 'Breakfast'),
(1, 'Eggs Benedict', 'Poached eggs on an English muffin with ham and hollandaise sauce.', 'EGB003', 16, 'Breakfast'),
(1, 'Caesar Salad', 'Crisp romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese, croutons, and a creamy Caesar dressing.', 'CSR004', 10, 'Lunch'),
(1, 'Grilled Chicken Caesar', 'Caesar Salad topped with grilled chicken.', 'CSG005', 14, 'Lunch'),
(1, 'Shrimp Caesar Salad', 'Caesar Salad topped with shrimp.', 'CSS006', 16, 'Lunch'),
(1, 'Quinoa Bowl', 'Quinoa & Roasted Vegetable Bowl mixed with a light lemon vinaigrette.', 'QRB007', 13, 'Lunch'),
(1, 'Club Sandwich', 'Classic triple-layered sandwich with turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise, served with fries.', 'CLB008', 14, 'Lunch'),
(1, 'Grilled Salmon', 'Grilled Salmon with a dill sauce, served alongside asparagus and quinoa.', 'GSM009', 25, 'Dinner'),
(1, 'Ribeye Steak', '8 oz. steak served with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables.', 'RBS010', 30, 'Dinner'),
(1, 'Pasta Primavera', 'Saut√©ed seasonal vegetables tossed with pasta in a light garlic and olive oil sauce.', 'PSP011', 18, 'Dinner'),
(1, 'Coffee', 'Freshly brewed, available in decaf or regular.', 'COF012', 4, 'Beverage'),
(1, 'Herbal Tea', 'A soothing selection of herbal teas.', 'TEH013', 3, 'Beverage'),
(1, 'Green Tea', 'Refreshing and aromatic green tea.', 'TEG014', 3, 'Beverage'),
(1, 'Black Tea', 'Robust and full-bodied black tea.', 'TEB015', 3, 'Beverage'),
(1, 'Coke', 'A classic favorite cola.', 'COK016', 2, 'Beverage'),
(1, 'Pepsi', 'A sweeter alternative cola.', 'PEP017', 2, 'Beverage'),
(1, 'Dr. Pepper', 'A unique blend of 23 flavors for an unmistakable taste.', 'DRP018', 2, 'Beverage'),
(1, 'Ribeye Steak Rare', 'Ribeye Steak cooked to a rare temperature.', 'RBR019', 30, 'Dinner'),
(1, 'Ribeye Steak Medium Rare', 'Ribeye Steak cooked to a medium rare temperature.', 'RBM020', 30, 'Dinner'),
(1, 'Ribeye Steak Medium', 'Ribeye Steak cooked to a medium temperature.', 'RBM021', 30, 'Dinner'),
(1, 'Ribeye Steak Medium Well', 'Ribeye Steak cooked to a medium well temperature.', 'RBW022', 30, 'Dinner'),
(1, 'Ribeye Steak Well Done', 'Ribeye Steak cooked to a well done temperature.', 'RBW023', 30, 'Dinner');
```

### 3. Setup an orders table

The below SQL first creates a custom enum type `order_status` if it doesn't already exist, with values to represent different stages of an order. Then, it creates a `roomie_orders` table to store order details.

```sql
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM pg_type WHERE typname = 'order_status'
    ) THEN
        CREATE TYPE order_status AS ENUM ('Pending', 'Processing', 'Sent', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled');
    END IF;
END$$;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS roomie_orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    created TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    roomie_company_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    notes VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    status order_status NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (roomie_company_id) REFERENCES roomie_company(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS roomie_orders_items (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    sku VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    qty INTEGER NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES roomie_orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### 4. Setup summary and post_prompt table.
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ai_summary (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    convo_id TEXT,
    summary TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ai_post_prompt (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    data JSONB
);
```
