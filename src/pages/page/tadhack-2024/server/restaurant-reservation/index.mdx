# Bobby's Table

#### AI Restaurant Reservation Demo

[bobbystable.ai](https://bobbystable.ai) is a functional demo of a restaurant reservation system built on SignalWire's APIs.

<div class="row">
    
    <div class="col col--6">

    On this page, you'll find a full breakdown of the prompts used, along with all the functions. The functions are written in Perl. To quickly access all relevant files, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/signalwire/digital_employees/tree/main/server/Perl_Examples/BobbysTable.ai).

:::tip Try it out! 
Dial `+1-754-432-6229` and watch your reservation show up live on [bobbystable.ai](https://bobbystable.ai).

## How it works

Bobby's Table has three primary interfaces:

 - A **public website** showing live reservations
 - A **password-protected backend log** exposing interactions between user, AI Agent, app functions, and the system
 - **SMS messages** delivered to the user with reservation updates

### 1. Public site

The website is used to display the reservation details. This could be protected with a username and password, but our [demo site](https://bobbystable.ai) is public for demonstration purposes.

- `Date:` Reservation date
- `Time:` Reservation time
- `Party Size:` Number of guests
- `Guest Name:` Name of the guest
- `Guest Number:` Phone number of the guest

### 2. Backend

This is a backend interface gated by a login user name and password.

- `user:` The caller's interaction
- `Assistant:` The AI bot's interaction
- `function:` This shows that the function was executed either correctly or incorrectly
- `system:` This is like the assistant but on a higher level

### 3. SMS

This is the text message sent that includes:

- Reservation name
- Reservation date and time
- Instructions on how to update the reservation online with a unique link
- The option to STOP (required for SMS regulatory compliance)

## Build it

In addition to what is included in the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/signalwire/digital_employees/tree/main/server/Perl_Examples/BobbysTable.ai), you will also need to set up the following components.

  - **Web server:** NGINX
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL
  - **Active SignalWire Space:** Accessed at `yourspace.signalwire.com`
  - **Signalwire API token**
  - **A registered/apporoved campaign for SMS** in your SignalWire Space

:::info
SMS is subject to additional regulation by carriers. If you haven't worked with SMS before, check out our comprehensive guide to [navigating the Campaign Registry process](https://developer.signalwire.com/guides/campaign-registry-all-you-need-to-know/).

## Function reference

This table succinctly outlines the necessary functions for the SWAIG (SignalWire AI Agent),
detailing the arguments required for each function and their respective purposes within the room service ordering process.

## Use case

Bobby's Table is a prime example of the way advanced telecommunications technologies and AI can transform established, inefficient, and error-prone ways of doing business. Case in point: Making a dinner reservation. Let's first briefly examine how this process usually works.

#### The Status Quo

*It's 11 AM and you're planning a nice dinner date. After looking up a restaurant online, you find their phone number and give it a call. The restaurant doesn't open until 3 PM, so you set a phone alarm and call back in the afternoon. By then, the kitchen is slammed and you wait on hold for 10 minutes before the staff can put your name down. When you arrive, the system has no record of your booking, so you end up waiting 45 minutes for a table. Surely there must be a better way.*

#### Reinventing Reservations

With Bobby's Table, you can give the restaurant a call any time of day (or night). The AI Agent prompts you for relevant information and offers a range of options. At the end of the conversation, your reservation is confirmed via text or email. You can update your reservation at any time, and access is secured via SignalWire's MFA API.
