**What:** The Thermal Thrillers AI demo is a versatile programmable AI assistant for a service business.
Its digital employee, who we've nicknamed Rachael, can answer the phone and complete a number of surprisingly complex administrative tasks.

**Why:** Administrative tasks at service businesses are an excellent test case for the power of AI combined with programmable telecom.
Today's off-the-shelf LLMs can reliably handle tasks that meet the following criteria at a level meeting or surpassing human agents:
 - Repetive and well-defined
 - Administrative and scheduling
 - After-hours

The Thermal Thrillers AI demo directly addresses one of the most common administrative pain points experienced by service businesses:
Scheduling and customer communication are often performed manually, over the phone, by office staff with other responsibilities.

Inefficiencies and bottlenecks inherent to this process result in poor customer experience,
whether caused by long wait times at peak hours, 
inability to reach the office outside of business hours, 
or data entry errors caused by the manual nature of the process.
This status quo also creates unpredictable and often overwhelming workloads for administrative staff.

**How:** This AI demo uses [SWML](https://developer.signalwire.com/swml) (SignalWire Markup Language)
in a **serverless context** to showcase how developers can quickly and easily build proof of concept applications.

SignalWire's tools and services streamline the otherwise complicated interfaces with telecom, LLMs, and TTS providers,
freeing developers to build innovative products and bring them to market.

## How it works

At SignalWire, we are pioneering the integration of advanced AI technology to revolutionize how businesses interact with customers. 
In this example, the digital employee, Rachael, will assist customers outside regular business hours and during peak times. 
Here's how Rachael can make your HVAC inquiries and service requests smoother and more efficient.

## Our Digital Employee, Rachael

Rachael is designed to be more than just a digital assistant. She is the forefront of our customer service, equipped to handle calls with the efficiency and understanding you'd expect from a human operator. Rachael is operational after hours, ensuring that Thermal Thrillers HVAC supports you 24/7.

### **Capabilities**

- **Scheduling Appointments:** Whether it's after hours or within our business hours (7:30AM to 5PM M-F), Rachael can schedule appointments and arrange for urgent service if needed.
- **Collecting Essential Information:** From service addresses to specific HVAC unit details, Rachael collects all necessary information to ensure our technicians are well-prepared for the job ahead.
- **Address Verification:** Rachael ensures the accuracy of your service address, enhancing service reliability.

### **Operational Hours and Payment Methods**

- **Business Hours:** Monday to Friday, 7:30AM to 5PM.
- **After Hours:** Service available through Rachael.
- **Payment Options:** We accept cash, checks, and credit cards for your convenience.

## How Rachael Works

The digital employee Rachael's interaction with customers is streamlined into several steps, ensuring a thorough collection of information while providing a friendly and helpful service.

1. **Greeting and Assistance:** Based on the time of your call, Rachael will greet you with the appropriate message and offer assistance.
2. **Information Gathering:** Rachael will guide you through a series of steps to gather all necessary information regarding your HVAC needs.
3. **Appointment Scheduling:** Depending on the time of your call, Rachael will either schedule an appointment or arrange for after-hours service.
