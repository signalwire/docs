## **1. Get started with WireStarter** {#wirestarter}

---

WireStarter is a Docker container which sets up the SignalWire SDKs and builds a development and testing environment for new developers.

Before following the below steps, please complete the following prerequisites:

  - Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  - Create a free [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/)
  - Sign up for a free [SignalWire Space](https://signalwire.com/signup)

The script we run in step 3 will ask for your 
SignalWire Space ID, 
SignalWire Project ID, 
SignalWire Project Token, 
ngrok Token, and 
ngrok Args (optional - mostly for custom domains), 
so make sure you have that information handy by opening the 
SignalWire ['tokens' page](https://my.signalwire.com?page=credentials) 
and the ngrok ['Your Authtoken' page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

Repeat these instructions anytime you need to start WireStarter again.

#### 1. Start Docker Desktop

Docker must be running at the start of the process.

#### 2. Download and install WireStarter

WireStarter has been updated recently. 
If you've used WireStarter before, be sure to delete the previous version and reinstall the latest version of the container.

```shell
docker run -it -d --rm --name wirestarter briankwest/wirestarter
```

This Docker command downloads and installs WireStarter (if it isn't already installed).
It then runs the container in the background and automatically removes it on exit.

#### 3. Configure WireStarter with SWSH

This command starts a terminal UI which will prompt you for relevant IDs and tokens.
It will walk you through configuring the development and testing environment so you can quickly deploy and test our [example applications](#examples). 
It then automatically enters SWSH (SignalWire Shell), the official SignalWire CLI.

```shell
docker exec -ti wirestarter bash 
```

      className="img-600" 
      src={require("./wirestarter-space.webp").default} 
      alt="A screenshot of the WireStarter interface. The user is prompted to enter their SignalWire Space domain."
    />
    <figcaption>WireStarter guides you through setting up a local development environment.</figcaption>
</figure>

When prompted, select your preferred editor: nano, vim, or emacs. 
We recommend nano for beginners.

Copy the SignalWire Space ID, Project ID, and Project token from [the API pane](https://my.signalwire.com?page=credentials) of your SignalWire Dashboard.
Copy the ngrok Token from the [Your Authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) ngrok page.
ngrok Args are optional and only needed if you want to use a custom ngrok domain name. If not, leave the text field blank and proceed.

#### 4. Buy and set up a phone number

After entering the SignalWire and ngrok information in the previous step, you will enter the SWSH CLI. 

<figure>
  <img 
    className="img-600" 
    src={require("./swsh.webp").default} 
    alt="A screenshot of the SWSH terminal."
  />
</figure>

Purchase and configure a phone number using the **`phone_number`** command.

Enter `help` or `help -v` to view more options for SWSH.

You can also purchase a phone number in the Web UI in your [SignalWire Space](https://my.signalwire.com?page=phone_numbers).

<figure>
    <img 
      className="img-800" 
      src={require("./number-purchased.webp").default} 
      alt="Screenshot of a purchased phone number."
    />
    <figcaption>Viewing purchased phone numbers in the SignalWire Dashboard.</figcaption>
</figure>

:::warning Name your numbers!
Phone numbers purchased in the Dashboard UI must be named before being assigned to these demos. 
Any name will work ‚Äî just edit and save the populated number as its own name. Numbers purchased in SWSH are not affected by this limitation.
:::

Once WireStarter is successfully configured, enter the `exit` command, or press `ctrl-C` once, to exit SWSH.

<div className="row">
    
    <div className="col col--4">

        #### 5. Run `setup.sh`

        From the same bash prompt, run `setup.sh` and select a demo.

        Follow the instructions to assign a phone number and finish setup.

        If you encounter any problems using WireStarter, please let us know by 
        [reporting an issue on its GitHub repo](https://github.com/signalwire/WireStarter/issues).

        You can also get live support in the [Community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/F2WNYTNjuF), or by emailing devex@signalwire.com.

## **2. Try out a demo** {#examples}

---

SignalWire's AI Agents are excellent customer interfaces for systems that involve creating and managing reservations, appointments, and calendar items. 
Consider the following potential applications, and then go create something even cooler!

### Serverless

Try out the following serverless examples in the Dashboard of your SignalWire Space. 
Navigate to the Relay/SWML sidebar item and the SWML Scripts tab, and
follow [these instructions](https://github.com/signalwire/digital_employees/tree/main/serverless)
to link your preferred SignalWire number to the demo.

These examples are written in Perl.

#### [üíê  Flo's Flowers 1.0](/page/tadhack-2024/serverless/virtual-flowers-demo) <span className="badge badge--info">Low-Code</span>

  - Send an SMS e-card with an image url to a user's phone number. 
  Flo will give four flower options to choose from to send. 
  The user can include a message with the flower image.

#### [‚òéÔ∏è  Thermal Thrillers](/page/tadhack-2024/serverless/admin-assistant) <span className="badge badge--warning">Moderate</span>

  - An interactive digital employee capable of taking messages and performing related tasks after hours at an HVAC firm.

#### [‚òîÔ∏è  Weather Bot](/page/tadhack-2024/serverless/weather-bot-demo) <span className="badge badge--info">Low-Code</span>

  - Uses the [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) API to fetch longitude and latitude values based on the provided city and state. 
  The bot then uses these coordinates and the [Weather.gov](https://api.weather.gov) API to retrieve the requested weather details.


### Server

The examples listed here are written in Perl. 
The AI-cal demo is available in both 
[Perl](https://github.com/signalwire/digital_employees/tree/main/server/Perl_Examples/aical) 
and [Node.js](https://github.com/signalwire/digital_employees/tree/main/server/Node_Examples/AI_Calendar_Demo) versions.

#### [üìÖ AI-cal](/page/tadhack-2024/server/ai-cal) <span className="badge badge--warning">Moderate</span>

  - AI-cal is an AI phone assistant that integrates with the 
  [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid)
  to add events to your Google Calendar.
  AI-cal uses Google Calendar's API to manage calendar entries based on user input, and OAuth2 for authentication with Google services. 
  - The `freebusy` function checks calendar availability, and the `events` function schedules events.
  - The application is structured around the PSGI specification, employing `Plack::Builder` to route HTTP requests to the appropriate handlers.
  This enables basic authentication, and managing user sessions and database connections for storing OAuth tokens and user information.

#### üå°Ô∏è  [ESP8266 Temperature & Humidity Sensor Bot](/page/tadhack-2024/server/esp8266-sensor-bot) <span className="badge badge--danger">Advanced</span>

  - Bobby is a digital employee who performs comprehensive reservation management tasks for a busy virtual restaurant. 
  Bobby can check for available dates and create a reservation based on date, time and party size.  
  Bobby is also capable of moving, cancelling, and altering reservations. 
  This example also uses the SignalWire MFA API to send a 6 digit code via SMS.

#### [üíê Flo's Flowers 2.0](/page/tadhack-2024/server/flos-flowers-2) <span className="badge badge--warning">Moderate</span>

  - Flo's Flowers 2.0 can send an SMS e-card with an image of any type of flower now. Just tell Flo what kind of flowers to send.

#### üîê  [MFA](/page/tadhack-2024/server/mfa) <span className="badge badge--warning">Moderate</span>

  - This digital employee is able to send a 6 digit code via SMS, and verify the 6 digit code with SignalWire's MFA API.

  - Roomie Serve is a digital assistant designed for use in hotels and hospitals, aimed at enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of room service orders. 
  Roomie Serve interfaces with a menu inventory database to facilitate the creation of room service orders.

#### [üåê  Zen](/page/tadhack-2024/server/tier-1-support) <span className="badge badge--danger">Advanced</span>

  - Zen is a digital employee for a mock cable company who performs Tier 1 support for cable modems.
