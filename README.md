## 💡 Overview

Welcome to SignalWire's open-source docs repository!

This README includes an overview of the project structure, requirements for contributors, and instructions for local development.

### 📚 Docs Wiki

The wiki hosts in-depth references and guides for maintaining, building, configuring, and deploying the docs site.

### 🏗️ Structure

The SignalWire Docs are built with <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a>.
Contents of the SignalWire Docs are organized by the following types:

- **Guides:** Introductions, quickstarts, examples, and how-to guides. These are written in Markdown/MDX and use the [docs plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction).
- **Technical Reference:** API and SDK reference docs. These also use the docs plugin, but in most cases are automatically generated from [TypeSpec](https://typespec.io/) or [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification files.
- **Pages:** Standalone specialty pages that use the [pages plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages), like the [Guides Showcase](https://developer.signalwire.com/guides) and unlisted references for UI components.

Consult the wiki's [Repository guide](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-docs/wiki/Repository-guide) for more information.

### 📜 License

The SignalWire Docs are available under the MIT license and Creative Commons **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** license.

3. **Install dependencies**

```
npm install
```

4. **Start the local development server**

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

```
npm run start
```

The built site is now ready for deployment!

### ☁️ REST API documentation

The pages related to REST APIs are defined in [TypeSpec](https://typespec.io/docs) which are then compiled into [OpenAPI Spec](https://swagger.io/specification/) files. 
These files live in the [`api`](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-docs/tree/main/api) directory.

Refer to the [REST API Specs & Docs](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-docs/wiki/REST-API-Specs-&-Docs) wiki article for more information.
