SWML offers a lot of flexibility in how you control program flow with it's control methods.
Of these, [`goto`], [`execute`], and [`transfer`] allow you to unconditionally control program flow.

## goto

The [`goto`] method is designed to allow you to jump to particular labels within a section.
Use this method to simulate more complex loops like `while` and `for` loops.

:::warning you can not jump to sections using goto.

Use [`execute`] described further below to jump sections.

:::

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - play:
        url: 'say:Entering infinite loop'
    - label: loop
    - play:
        url: 'say:Looping ...'
    - goto:
        label: loop

```

```mermaid
graph LR;
    loop["loop"]
    main --> loop
    loop -- goto --> loop
```

## execute

The [`execute`] method allows you to invoke a subsection as a function. You can pass parameters to the function
and receive a return value.

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - play:
        url: 'say:Transferring you to another section'
    - execute:
        dest: subsection
    - play:
        url: 'say: %{return_value}'
  subsection:
    - play:
        url: 'say:inside a subsection'
    - return: back!
```

Output transcript:

```
"Transferring you to another section"
"inside a subsection"
"back!"
```

```mermaid
graph LR;
    main --> subsection
    subsection --"back!"--> main
```

Or in a more complex example:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - play:
        url: 'say:Transferring you to another section'
    - execute:
        dest: subsection
        params:
          a: 1
          b: 2
    - play:
        url: 'say: %{return_value}'
  subsection:
    - return: '%{params.a+params.b}'
```

```mermaid
graph LR;
    main -- "a:1, b:2" --> subsection
    subsection -- "12" --> main
```

## transfer

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - play:
        url: 'say:Transferring you to another section'
    - transfer:
        dest: subsection
    - play:
        url: 'say:Back!'
  subsection:
    - play:
        url: 'say:inside a subsection'
```

Output transcript:

```
"Transferring you to another section"
"inside a subsection"
```

:::info
Notice how we aren't going back to the calling section at all.
:::

```mermaid
graph LR;
    main -- "params, vars, etc" --> subsection
```
