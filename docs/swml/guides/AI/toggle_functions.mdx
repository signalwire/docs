# Using `toggle_functions`

In this example, the `transfer` function is toggled off from the start. The AI agent will toggle this
function on after the `get_joke` function is called and will also toggle the `get_joke` function off. This creates a scenario where a user can only
be transferred after hearing a joke from the AI, and can only request one joke. The AI agent will then match the transfer destination
based on the user's input, with the `meta_data` table serving as a directory for the transfer destinations.
If no match is found, the AI agent will fall back to the `".*"` expression, which will inform the user
that the transfer was unsuccessful and requires a valid input.

## **`transfer` Function**

```yaml andJson
SWAIG:
  functions:
    - function: transfer
      active: "false"
      purpose: use to transfer to a target
      argument:
        type: object
        properties:
          target:
            description: the target to transfer to
            type: string
      data_map:
        expressions:
          - pattern: "\\w+"
            string: "%{meta_data.table.%{lc:args.target}}"
            output:
              action:
                - say: Please stand by while I connect your call.
                - SWML:
                    version: 1.0.0
                    sections:
                      main:
                        - connect:
                            to: "%{meta_data.table.%{lc:args.target}}"
                - stop: "true"
              response: transferred, the call has ended.
          - string: "%{args.target}"
            pattern: ".*"
            output:
              response: "I'm sorry, I was unable to transfer your call to %{input.args.target}."
      meta_data:
        table:
          support: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
          sales: "+1YYYYYYYYYY"
```

We set the function to being toggled off with the following line:

```yaml
active: "false"
```
---

## **`get_joke` Function**

```yaml andJson
- function: get_joke
  purpose: use to get a joke
  data_map:
    webhooks:
      - url: 'https://example.com/v1/%{args.type}'
        headers:
          X-Api-Key: api-token-here
        method: GET
        output:
          response: "Tell the user: %{array[0].joke}." # array[0] is the first joke in the array
          action:
            - toggle_functions:
                - active: true
                  function: transfer
                - active: false
                  function: get_joke
```

In the above function, we set the `transfer` function to be toggled on.
Now when a user asks to be transferred, the AI agent will now be able to do so because the `transfer` function is toggled on.
Additionally, the `get_joke` function is toggled off, so the user will not be able to request another joke.

```yaml andJson
- toggle_functions:
    - active: true
      function: transfer
    - active: false
      function: get_joke
```

## **Full example**

```yaml andJson
sections:
  main:
    - ai:
        prompt:
          text: >-
            Your name is Frank. You help transfer to the right department. Use
            the 'get_joke' function to get a joke.

            # Greetings Greet the user, and inform them that your name is Frank
            and you can help assist them in transferring the call to Support or
            Sales. However, let them know the only way to be transferred is to
            hear a joke.

            # Rules  A user cannot be transferred until they have asked for at
            least one joke throughout the call.  When a user is able to be
            transferred, use the 'transfer' function. Only provide one joke to
            the user, if the user asks for more jokes after the first one, tell
            them you are no longer giving out jokes, but can help with
            transferring the call to a different department.
