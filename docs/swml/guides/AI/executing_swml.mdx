# Executing SWML from a SWAIG function

`SWAIG` functions allow you to execute `SWML` from within itself.
This allows you to create a function that can be used to execute a specific SWML block, that lives outside the
AI language model. The benefit of this is you can get more granular control over the execution of what happens next after the function
is triggered while also getting the additional benefits of SignalWire's APIs.

For this example, we will create an AI and who will help assist with transferring the call.
The AI will ask the user for a destination to transfer to, and then execute a function to
send an SMS to notify the destination that they have a call coming in, and then transfer the call.

## **Enabling SWML Execution**

The first important step is to make sure our AI is capable of executing SWML in its functions.
In the [`ai.params`](../../methods/ai/ai_params/index.mdx), you will need to set the parameter `swaig_allow_swml` to `true`, to allow SWML execution:

```yaml andJson
params:
  swaig_allow_swml: true
```

## **Data Map Example**

In this example, we are using the `data_map` to execute SWML in the `data_map.expressions.output.action`.

### Creating the Function

We will create a function that will send an SMS to the destination number, and then transfer the call to the destination number.

```yaml andJson
SWAIG:
  functions:
    - function: transfer
      purpose: Get input from user and transfer to a destination department
      argument:
        type: object
        properties:
          destination:
            type: string
            description: The destination to transfer to
      data_map:
        expressions:
          - string: "%{args.destination}"
            pattern: .*
            output:
              response: Transferring call.
              action:
                - SWML:
                    sections:
                      main:
                        - send_sms:
                            to_number: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
                            from_number: "+1YYYYYYYYYY"
                            body: "Call coming from %{caller_id_num}"
                        - connect:
                            to: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
                - stop: true
```

### SWML Execution

We are using the `SWML` action to execute the SWML block that will send the SMS using the [`send_sms`](../../methods/send_sms.mdx) method and then connect the call to the destination number
using the [`connect`](../../methods/connect/index.mdx) method.

```yaml andJson
action:
  - SWML:
      sections:
        main:
          - send_sms:
              to_number: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
              from_number: "+1YYYYYYYYYY"
              body: 'Call coming from %{caller_id_num}'
          - connect:
              to: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
```

### Full Example

```yaml andJson
sections:
  main:
    - ai:
        prompt:
          text: |-
            Your name is Frank. You help the user with transferring calls.
            ## Handling The User
            - You are asked to transfer a call.
            - You ask for the destination.
            - You use the 'transfer' function to transfer the call.
        post_prompt_url: https://example.com/post_prompt_url
        params:
          swaig_allow_swml: true
        SWAIG:
          functions:
            - function: transfer
              purpose: Get input from user and transfer to a destination department
              argument:
                type: object
                properties:
                  destination:
                    type: string
                    description: The destination to transfer to
              data_map:
                expressions:
                  - string: '%{args.destination}'
                    pattern: .*
                    output:
                      response: Transferring call.
                      action:
                        - SWML:
                            sections:
                              main:
                                - send_sms:
                                    to_number: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
                                    from_number: "+1YYYYYYYYYY"
                                    body: 'Call coming from %{caller_id_num}'
                                - connect:
                                    to: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
                        - stop: true
        hints:
          - transfer
```

## **Webhook Example**

In this example, we are using the `function.web_hook_url` to execute SWML.

### Creating the Function

We will create a function that will take the input from the user as an argument (_destination_) and then make a request
to the `function.web_hook_url`.

```yaml andJson
SWAIG:
  functions:
    - function: transfer
      web_hook_url: "https://example.com/transfer"
      purpose: Get input from user and transfer to a destination department
      argument:
        type: object
        properties:
          destination:
            type: string
            description: The destination to transfer to
```

### SWML Execution

When executing `SWML` while utilizing a `function.web_hook_url`, you will need to provide a response
from the `function.web_hook_url` that contains the `action` key. In this `action` key
you will need to provide the `SWML` block that you want to execute.

**Format**:

```json
{
  "response": "The response to the AI",
  "action": ["The SWML block to execute"]
}
```

**Webhook Response Example**:

We are using the `SWML` action to execute the SWML block that will send the SMS using the [`send_sms`](../../methods/send_sms)
method and then connect the call to the destination number using the [`connect`](../../methods/connect/index.mdx) method.

```yaml andJson
response: Transferring call.
action:
  - SWML:
      sections:
        main:
          - send_sms:
              to_number: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
              from_number: "+1YYYYYYYYYY"
              body: 'Call coming from %{caller_id_num}'
          - connect:
              to: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
```
