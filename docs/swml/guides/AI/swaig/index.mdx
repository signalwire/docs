# SWAIG 

<Subtitle>The SignalWire AI Gateway</Subtitle><br/><br/>

SWAIG (SignalWire AI Gateway) allows AI Agents to delegate tasks to your backend via HTTP POST. 
Think of it like CGI for AIâ€”but instead of messy query strings, you receive clean, structured JSON with context, arguments, and intent.

## About

When a SWAIG function is invoked by the AI Agent, your server receives a JSON payload containing:
* The `function` name to be executed.
* The structured arguments in `argument.parsed`.
* Contextual metadata (caller ID, project ID, session ID, etc.).

---

## Example script

```json
{
    "description": "Search for movies by title",
    "function": "search_movie",
    "parameters": {
      "properties": {
        "include_adult": {
          "description": "Whether to include adult content",
          "type": "boolean"
        },
        "language": {
          "description": "Language of the results",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "page": {
          "description": "Page number for pagination",
          "type": "integer"
        },
        "primary_release_year": {
          "description": "Filter results by primary release year",
          "type": "integer"
        },
        "query": {
          "description": "The movie title to search for",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "region": {
          "description": "Specify a region to prioritize search results",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "year": {
          "description": "Filter results by release year",
          "type": "integer"
        }
      },
      "required": [],
      "type": "object"
    },
    "web_hook_url": "https://username:password@moviebot.example.com/swaig"
  }
```

The following sample script creates the SWAIG function `search_movie`:

## Example request

```json
{
  "function": "search_movie",
  "argument": {
    "parsed": [
      {
        "query": "Pretty Woman"
      }
    ],
    "raw": "{\"query\":\"Pretty Woman\"}"
  },
  "argument_desc": {
    "properties": {
      "query": { "type": "string", "description": "The movie title to search for" },
      "year": { "type": "integer" }
    },
    "type": "object"
  },
  "ai_session_id": "c960da54-3f09-4de6-8c84-49c1fcca704c",
  "caller_id_num": "+19184249378",
  "project_id": "625ceaeb-b27c-46b9-9b69-9d62286588ec"
}
```

## Response Format

Your server should return a JSON object with the following:
* **`response`** (string): A message in Markdown format used by the LLM in its reply.
* **`action`** (array): Optional list of SWML-compatible objects that can execute commands, play media, set metadata, or return inline SWML.

### âœ… Example Response

```json
{
  "response": "**Pretty Woman** is a 1990 romantic comedy starring *Julia Roberts* as Vivian Ward, a spirited Hollywood escort, and *Richard Gere* as Edward Lewis, a wealthy businessman. Directed by Garry Marshall, the film tells the story of their unexpected romance that begins as a business deal and blossoms into a modern fairytale.  
Set against the glitz of Los Angeles, the movie features iconic momentsâ€”like the Rodeo Drive shopping spree and a memorable opera night. It explores themes of class, love, transformation, and empowerment. Julia Robertsâ€™ performance won her a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. It's now considered one of the most iconic romantic comedies ever made.",
  "action": [
    {
      "set_meta_data": {
        "title": "Pretty Woman",
        "release_year": 1990,
        "genre": ["Romance", "Comedy"],
        "lead_actors": ["Julia Roberts", "Richard Gere"]
      }
    },
    {
      "SWML": {
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "sections": {
          "main": [
            {
              "play": {
                "url": "https://cdn.signalwire.com/swml/pretty-woman-theme.mp3"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This format allows you to:
* Enrich the AI context with metadata using `set_meta_data`.
* Trigger advanced call logic using embedded SWML.

## ðŸ”š Summary

To integrate with SWAIG:
1. Accept a POST request with structured JSON.
2. Extract the function name and `argument.parsed`.
3. Execute your business logic.
4. Return a `response` message and optionally an `action` array to control behavior or media.
The power of SWAIG is in how seamlessly it lets your logic drive AI Agent behavior in both conversation and call flow.
