# SWAIG 

<Subtitle>The SignalWire AI Gateway</Subtitle><br/><br/>

SWAIG (SignalWire AI Gateway) allows AI Agents to delegate tasks to your backend via HTTP POST. 
Think of it like CGI (Common Gateway Interface) - where a web server hands off execution to an external program using raw query strings or form-encoded data  - but for AI Agents.
With SWAIG, instead of messy query strings requiring tedious parsing and validation, you receive clean, structured JSON with context, arguments, and intent.

SWAIG requests include rich context:
* The function name (e.g., `"search_movie"`),
* Parsed arguments in the structured `argument.parsed` field,
* The full argument schema (`argument_desc`) to describe expected inputs
* Session, caller, and project context so you can make smart decisions without additional lookups

## Remote functions

<Steps>

### Accept a POST request

When a SWAIG function is invoked by the AI Agent, your server receives a JSON payload containing:
* The `function` name to be executed.
* The structured arguments in `argument.parsed`.
* Contextual metadata (caller ID, project ID, session ID, etc.).

From this request, extract the function name and `argument.parsed`.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Example SWAIG function" description="Expand this item to view the full SWAIG function for this example.">

The following sample SWML creates the SWAIG function `search_movie`:

<Accordion title="Example request sent to server" description="When your SWAIG function executes, SignalWire sends a request like the following to your server." defaultOpen={true}>

When your SWAIG function executes, SignalWire sends a request like the following to your server.

<SwaigRequest/>

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Execute business logic

On your server, perform the actions needed to generate the desired response using the extracted function name and arguments.

In this case, our application retrieves information about a selected movie from an external API.

### Return a `response` message

The response can directly shape the AI Agentâ€™s next moves using natural language and SWML instructions.

In reply, your server should return a JSON object with the following:
* **`response`** (string): A message in Markdown format used by the LLM in its reply.
* **`action`** (array): Optional list of SWML-compatible objects that can execute commands, play media, set metadata, or return inline SWML.

For example:

<Accordion title="Response to SWAIG request" defaultOpen={true}>

Note that this response includes both **response** and **action** sections.
This means that our server has both updated the LLM's context with the requested information from an external API,
***and*** handed off new call flow instructions in the form of valid SWML.

<SwaigResponse/>

</Accordion>

</Steps>

This format allows you to:
* Enrich the AI context with metadata using `set_meta_data`.
* Trigger advanced call logic using embedded SWML.
