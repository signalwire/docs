# SWAIG 

<Subtitle>The SignalWire AI Gateway</Subtitle><br/><br/>

SWAIG (SignalWire AI Gateway) allows AI Agents to delegate tasks to your backend via HTTP POST. 
Think of it like CGI for AIâ€”but instead of messy query strings, you receive clean, structured JSON with context, arguments, and intent.
The power of SWAIG is in how seamlessly it lets your logic drive AI Agent behavior in both conversation and call flow.

## Use SWAIG with remote functions

<Steps>

### Accept a POST request

When a SWAIG function is invoked by the AI Agent, your server receives a JSON payload containing:
* The `function` name to be executed.
* The structured arguments in `argument.parsed`.
* Contextual metadata (caller ID, project ID, session ID, etc.).

From this request, extract the function name and `argument.parsed`.

### Execute business logic

On your server, perform the actions needed to generate the desired response using the extracted function name and arguments.

### Return a `response` message

In reply, your server should return a JSON object with the following:
* **`response`** (string): A message in Markdown format used by the LLM in its reply.
* **`action`** (array): Optional list of SWML-compatible objects that can execute commands, play media, set metadata, or return inline SWML.

For example:

<SwaigResponse/>

</Steps>

## Example

<div className="row">
    
    <div className="col col--6">

        ### SWAIG function

        The following sample SWML creates the SWAIG function `search_movie`:

        <SwaigFunction/>
        
    </div>
    
    <div className="col col--6">

        ### Request

        When your SWAIG function executes, SignalWire sends a request to your server that looks like this:

        <SwaigRequest/>
        
    </div>
    
</div>

This format allows you to:
* Enrich the AI context with metadata using `set_meta_data`.
* Trigger advanced call logic using embedded SWML.
