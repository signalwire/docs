# Security guide

This guide covers the security features and configuration options available in SignalWire AI Agents SDK for both SWML-based services (including AgentBase) and the standalone Search Service.

## Overview

The SDK provides a unified security configuration system that ensures consistent security behavior across all services. All security settings are controlled through environment variables, with secure defaults that can be overridden as needed.

## Quick start

### Basic HTTPS setup

To enable HTTPS for any service:

```bash
export SWML_SSL_ENABLED=true
export SWML_SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cert.pem
export SWML_SSL_KEY_PATH=/path/to/key.pem
export SWML_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
```

### Basic authentication

Basic authentication is enabled by default with auto-generated credentials. To set custom credentials:

```bash
export SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER=myusername
export SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=mysecurepassword
```

## Environment variables

### SSL/TLS configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SWML_SSL_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable HTTPS (`true`, `1`, `yes` to enable) |
| `SWML_SSL_CERT_PATH` | - | Path to SSL certificate file |
| `SWML_SSL_KEY_PATH` | - | Path to SSL private key file |
| `SWML_DOMAIN` | - | Domain name for SSL (used for URL generation) |
| `SWML_SSL_VERIFY_MODE` | `CERT_REQUIRED` | SSL verification mode |

### Authentication

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER` | `signalwire` | Basic auth username |
| `SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` | *auto-generated* | Basic auth password (32-char token if not set) |

### Security headers and policies

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SWML_USE_HSTS` | `true` | Enable HSTS when HTTPS is active |
| `SWML_HSTS_MAX_AGE` | `31536000` | HSTS max-age in seconds (1 year) |
| `SWML_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `*` | Comma-separated list of allowed hosts |
| `SWML_CORS_ORIGINS` | `*` | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins |

### Request limits

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SWML_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE` | `10485760` | Maximum request size in bytes (10MB) |
| `SWML_RATE_LIMIT` | `60` | Requests per minute limit |
| `SWML_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | `30` | Request timeout in seconds |

## Service-specific usage

### SWML services (AgentBase)

SWML-based services automatically use the unified security configuration:

```python
from signalwire_agents import AgentBase

class MyAgent(AgentBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="secure-agent", route="/agent")
        # Security is automatically configured from environment

# The agent will use HTTPS if SWML_SSL_ENABLED=true
agent = MyAgent()
agent.run()
```

### Search service

The standalone search service also supports the same security configuration:

```python
from signalwire_agents.search import SearchService

# Basic usage - security configured from environment
service = SearchService(port=8001, indexes={"docs": "index.swsearch"})
service.start()

# Override SSL settings programmatically
service.start(
    host="0.0.0.0",
    port=8001,
    ssl_cert="/path/to/cert.pem",
    ssl_key="/path/to/key.pem"
)
```

## Security headers

When HTTPS is enabled, the following security headers are automatically added to responses:

- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Forces HTTPS connections (when `SWML_USE_HSTS=true`)
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`: Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`: Enables XSS filtering
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`: Controls referrer information

## CORS configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to:
- Allow credentials
- Allow all methods by default
- Allow all headers by default
- Origins controlled by `SWML_CORS_ORIGINS`

To restrict CORS to specific domains:

```bash
export SWML_CORS_ORIGINS="https://app1.example.com,https://app2.example.com"
```

## Host validation

By default, all hosts are allowed (`SWML_ALLOWED_HOSTS=*`). To restrict to specific hosts:

```bash
export SWML_ALLOWED_HOSTS="example.com,api.example.com"
```

## Best practices

### 1. Production HTTPS setup

For production environments, always enable HTTPS:

```bash
# Production configuration
export SWML_SSL_ENABLED=true
export SWML_SSL_CERT_PATH=/etc/ssl/certs/server.crt
export SWML_SSL_KEY_PATH=/etc/ssl/private/server.key
export SWML_DOMAIN=api.yourdomain.com
export SWML_ALLOWED_HOSTS=api.yourdomain.com
export SWML_CORS_ORIGINS=https://app.yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Strong authentication

Always set strong credentials in production:

```bash
export SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER=api_user
export SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

### 3. Certificate management

- Use certificates from a trusted CA in production
- For development, you can generate self-signed certificates:

```bash
# Generate self-signed certificate for development
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

### 4. Rate limiting

Adjust rate limits based on your usage patterns:

```bash
# Higher rate limit for internal services
export SWML_RATE_LIMIT=300

# Lower rate limit for public APIs
export SWML_RATE_LIMIT=20
```

### 5. Monitoring

Monitor security-related logs:

```python
# Security events are logged with structured data
# Look for log entries with:
# - "security_config_loaded" - Configuration details
# - "ssl_config_invalid" - SSL configuration errors
# - "starting_search_service" / "starting_server" - Service startup with security info
```

## Migration guide

### From previous versions

If you were using environment variables directly before:

**Old approach:**
```bash
export SWML_SSL_ENABLED=true
export SWML_SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cert.pem
```

**New approach (still supported):**
```bash
# Environment variables continue to work exactly as before
export SWML_SSL_ENABLED=true
export SWML_SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cert.pem
```

**Enhanced with configuration files:**
```json
{
  "security": {
    "ssl_enabled": "${SWML_SSL_ENABLED|false}",
    "ssl_cert_path": "${SWML_SSL_CERT_PATH}",
    "ssl_key_path": "${SWML_SSL_KEY_PATH}"
  }
}
```

## Common security scenarios

### Development environment

```bash
# Minimal security for local development
export SWML_SSL_ENABLED=false
export SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER=dev
export SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=devpass123
export SWML_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

### Staging environment

```bash
# HTTPS with self-signed certificate
export SWML_SSL_ENABLED=true
export SWML_SSL_CERT_PATH=/etc/ssl/staging-cert.pem
export SWML_SSL_KEY_PATH=/etc/ssl/staging-key.pem
export SWML_DOMAIN=staging.yourdomain.com
export SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER=staging_user
export SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=staging_secure_password
```

### Production environment

```bash
# Full security configuration
export SWML_SSL_ENABLED=true
export SWML_SSL_CERT_PATH=/etc/ssl/certs/prod-cert.pem
export SWML_SSL_KEY_PATH=/etc/ssl/private/prod-key.pem
export SWML_DOMAIN=api.yourdomain.com
export SWML_ALLOWED_HOSTS=api.yourdomain.com
export SWML_CORS_ORIGINS=https://app.yourdomain.com
export SWML_BASIC_AUTH_USER=prod_api_user
export SWML_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export SWML_RATE_LIMIT=60
export SWML_USE_HSTS=true
```

## Security checklist

### Before deployment

- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid certificates
- [ ] Strong authentication credentials set
- [ ] Allowed hosts configured (not using `*` in production)
- [ ] CORS origins restricted to known domains
- [ ] Rate limiting configured appropriately
- [ ] Security headers enabled
- [ ] Request size limits set appropriately
- [ ] Monitoring and logging configured

### Ongoing maintenance

- [ ] Regularly rotate authentication credentials
- [ ] Monitor for certificate expiration
- [ ] Review security logs for anomalies
- [ ] Update rate limits based on usage patterns
- [ ] Test security configuration in staging
- [ ] Keep SSL/TLS configuration current

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**SSL Certificate errors:**
- Verify certificate and key file paths
- Check certificate validity and expiration
- Ensure proper file permissions

**Authentication failures:**
- Verify username and password are set correctly
- Check for special characters in credentials
- Ensure credentials match client configuration

**CORS issues:**
- Verify CORS origins are properly formatted
- Check for trailing slashes in URLs
- Ensure protocol (http/https) matches
