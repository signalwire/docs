# Quickstart

<Subtitle>Agents SDK</Subtitle><br/><br/>

Get up and running quickly with the SignalWire AI Agents SDK. 
This section covers installation, basic setup, and your first AI agent implementation.

## Prerequisites



<Steps>

## Set up a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# On macOS and some other Unix systems, use python3 for this step.
# After activating, `python` alone can be used.
```

Next, run the activation script corresponding to your shell:

<VenvScript/>

## Install the SDK

With a virtual environment activated, 
install the latest release of the Agents SDK and its dependencies.

```bash
pip install signalwire-agents
```

## Create your first agent

Create `dev-agent.py` and copy in the boilerplate below.

```python title="dev-agent.py"
from signalwire_agents import AgentBase

# Create an agent and assign a route
agent = AgentBase("My Assistant", route="/assistant")

# Add some basic capabilities
agent.add_skill("datetime")     # Current date/time info
agent.add_skill("math")         # Mathematical calculations

# Start the agent
agent.serve()
```

Done! It's literally that simple.
We've created and named an agent, given it a route on our server,
and taught it the `datetime` and `math` skills.

## Serve the agent

Our boilerplate script above creates a new agent and assigns it a route on your server.
To verify everything is working as it should,
let's run the server locally.

```bash
python dev-agent.py
```

## Test the server

Great! The server is running.
Next, let's make an authenticated request to see the SWML generated by our boilerplate application.
For now, we'll use the basic auth generated by the server.
By default, the username is `signalwire`.
Copy the generated password from the terminal on the line starting with `Basic Auth`.

```bash
curl signalwire:password@0.0.0.0:8000/assistant
```

You'll get back a payload of unstructured JSON.
That's right, SWML is JSON!

To read it more easily, pipe the result into `jq`, or open 
<a href="0.0.0.0:8000/assistant" target="_blank">0.0.0.0:8000/assistant</a>
in the pretty print view available in most browsers.

This basic SWML script is how the SignalWire cloud platform interacts with your application.
When you configure a SignalWire phone number to call the application,
SignalWire requests and processes SWML from your server.

## Expose development server via tunnel

To let SignalWire make requests to your server running locally,
we'll use Ngrok (or your tunneling service of choice) to expose

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Verify that the tunneling is working with the same command as before.
Replace `0.0.0.0` with your temporary hosted URL.
You should get the same JSON response.

```bash
curl https://signalwire:{{password}}@{{generated-url}}.ngrok-free.app:8000/assistant
```

## Assign a phone number

We're almost done!
The final step is to purchase and assign a phone number in your SignalWire Dashboard.
In the Assign Resource menu, select **SWML Script**.
Under **Primary Script**, set **Handle Calls Using** and select **External URL**.
Here, paste the URL you just tested.

```bash
https://signalwire:{{password}}@{{generated-url}}.ngrok-free.app:8000/assistant
```

Finally, click **Save**.

## Try it out

With your application created, server running, tunnel live, and phone number configured,
you can now call and talk to your brand-new Agent at its phone number. ðŸŽ‰

## What's next?

Now that you have a basic agent running, explore these advanced topics:

- **[Configuration guide](/sdks/agents-sdk/configuration)**: Set up JSON configuration files and environment variable substitution
- **[Security guide](/sdks/agents-sdk/security)**: Configure HTTPS, authentication, and production security
- **[CLI tools](/sdks/agents-sdk/cli)**: Test and debug your agents with the command-line interface
