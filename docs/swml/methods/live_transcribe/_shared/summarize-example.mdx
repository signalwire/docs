In the below example, the SWML script answers an incoming call and then starts recording the call.
The script then initiates a `summarize` action to summarize the conversation. A webhook url
is provided to send the summarized conversation to a webhook, and the `prompt` parameter is used to provide
instructions to the AI on how to summarize the conversation.

```yaml andJson
sections:
  main:
    - answer: {}
    - record_call:
        format: wav
        stereo: 'true'
    - live_transcribe:
        action:
          summarize:
            webhook: 'https://example.com/webhook'
            prompt: Summarize the key points of this conversation.
    - connect:
        from: '+1XXXXXXXXXX'
        to: '+1XXXXXXXXXX'
```
