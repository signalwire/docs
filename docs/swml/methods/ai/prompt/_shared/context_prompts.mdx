| `contexts`<span className="required-arg">Required</span> | `object` | - | An object that defines the available contexts for the AI. Each context represents a set of steps that guide the flow of the conversation. The object must include a `default` key, which specifies the initial context used at the start of the conversation. Additional contexts can be added as other keys within the object. For more details, see the [contexts technical reference][contexts]. |
| `text`<span className="optional-arg">Optional</span>                                  | `string` | -       | The global prompt that can be used along side the contexts step prompts. The prompt here will be retained in the agents memory even when the context or step has changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
