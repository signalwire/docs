An object that defines the context steps for the AI. The contexts are used to define the flow of the conversation.
Every context object requires a `default` key, which is the default context that's used at the beginning of the conversation.
Additionally, more contexts can be defined as any other key in the object.

| `default`<span className="required-arg">Required</span>       | `object` | -       | The default context to use at the beginning of the conversation. This object accepts the [`steps object`](./steps/index.mdx).                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `[key: string]`<span className="optional-arg">Optional</span> | `object` | -       | An additional context steps to define the flow of the conversation. This is a key that is user-defined and can be any string.<br/> Additional context can be swapped to from the `default` context or any other user-defined context.<br/> The value is an object that accepts the [`steps object`](./steps/index.mdx). |


## Example

In the below example, we have three contexts: `default`, `starwars`, and `startrek`.
The `default` context is the starting context for the conversation, and figuring out what the user wants to talk about.
The `starwars` and `startrek` contexts are additional contexts that can be swapped to from the `default` context.
Each AI context will have a unique voice and specialized in a specific topic.
Both the `starwars` and `startrek` contexts have a `question` step that will ask the user what they want to talk about,
or if the user wishes to change experts.

This allows the AI to have a more in-depth conversation with the user and provide a more personalized experience.
