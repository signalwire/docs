title: "CallRecording"
---

Represents a recording of a call. You can obtain instances of this class by starting a Recording with one of the following methods:

- [`Call.record`](./voice-call.mdx#record)
- [`Call.recordAudio`](./voice-call.mdx#recordaudio)

#### Example

Recording the audio of the call as soon as the other party answers the phone. We
also print the id of the recording and, when it ends, the URL (which can be used
to download the recording).

```js
import { Voice } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = new Voice.Client({
  project: "<project-id>",
  token: "<api-token>",
  topics: ["office"],
});

const call = await client.dialPhone({
  from: "+YYYYYYYYYY",
  to: "+XXXXXXXXXX",
});

await call.playTTS({ text: "This call will be recorded." });

// Print out the URL of the recording, as soon as the recording ends.
call.on("recording.ended", (recording) => {
  console.log("Recording URL:", recording.url);
});

// Start recording
const recording = await call.recordAudio({
  direction: "both",
  endSilenceTimeout: 0,
  terminators: "",
});
console.log("Recording id:", recording.id);
```
