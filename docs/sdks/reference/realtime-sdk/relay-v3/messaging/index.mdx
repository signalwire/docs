:::info Welcome to the latest version of the RELAY SDK

In May 2022, Messaging was incorporated into the latest version of the RELAY Realtime Server SDK. If you have an application that runs on the [previous version of RELAY](https://docs.signalwire.com/reference/relay-sdk-nodejs/v2/#relay-sdk-for-node-js) for Messaging, consider upgrading to the latest. For some pointers on migrating to this new version, please read our post ["Upgrade Your RELAY Game"](https://signalwire.com/blogs/developers/upgrade-your-relay-game).

:::

Access the Messaging API. You can instantiate a [Messaging.Client](./messaging-client.mdx) to send or receive SMS and MMS. Please check [Messaging Events](./messaging-client.mdx#events) for the full list of events that a [Messaging.Client](./messaging-client.mdx) can subscribe to.

#### Example

The following example listens for incoming SMS messages over an "office" topic, and also sends an SMS.

```javascript
import { Messaging } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = new Messaging.Client({
  project: "<project-id>",
  token: "<api-token>",
  topics: ["office"],
});

client.on("message.received", (message) => {
  console.log("message.received", message);
});

await client.send({
  from: "+1xxx",
  to: "+1yyy",
  body: "Hello World!",
});
```

## Classes

- [Client](./messaging-client.mdx)
- [MessageContract](./messaging-messagecontract.md)
- [MessagingSendResult](./messaging-messagingsendresult.md)
