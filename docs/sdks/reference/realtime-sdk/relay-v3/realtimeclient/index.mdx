:::caution Deprecated

It's no longer needed to create the client manually. You can use the product constructors, like [Video.Client](../video/video-client.mdx), to access the same functionality.

:::

A real-time Client.
To construct an instance of this class, please use [createClient](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk/relay-v3#createclient).

Example usage:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

// Obtain a client:
const client = await createClient({ project, token });

// Listen on events:
client.video.on("room.started", async (room) => {});

// Connect:
await client.connect();
```

## Properties

## Methods

### ~~connect~~

▸ **connect**(): `Promise<RealtimeClient>`

Connects this client to the SignalWire network.

As a general best practice, it is suggested to connect the event listeners _before_ connecting the client, so that no events are lost.

#### Returns

`Promise<RealtimeClient>`

Upon connection, asynchronously returns an instance of this same object.

#### Example

```typescript
const client = await createClient({ project, token });
client.video.on("room.started", async (roomSession) => {}); // connect events
await client.connect();
```

### ~~disconnect~~

▸ **disconnect**(): `void`

Disconnects this client from the SignalWire network.

#### Returns

`void`
