# Overview


The RELAY v4 SDK significantly improves the RELAY v3 SDK by introducing a unified client architecture
that consolidates multiple communication functionalities into a single client.
This enhancement simplifies the development process, reducing code complexity and making applications easier to maintain.
Relay V4 also improves event handling and promise resolution, offering more precise control
over application flows and asynchronous operations. These improvements make RELAY v4 more intuitive and efficient for developers,
enabling the creation of sophisticated real-time communication applications with greater ease and flexibility.

## **Installation**

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @signalwire/realtime-api
```

## **Getting started**

To get started, create a [Realtime-Client](./realtime-client/index.mdx)

Once you have a client, you can then choose a namespace to work with. Each namespace
provides a set of methods to interact with the SignalWire RealTime APIs.

Here is an example of how to use the Voice namespace to make an outbound phone call:


```js
import { SignalWire, Voice } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const voiceClient = client.voice

try {
  const call = await voiceClient.dialPhone({
    from: "+YYYYYYYYYY",
    to: "+XXXXXXXXXX",
    timeout: 30
  });
  console.log("Call answered.", call);
} catch (e) {
  console.log("Call not answered.", e);
}
```
