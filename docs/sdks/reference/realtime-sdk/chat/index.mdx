# Chat

Access the Chat API Consumer. You can instantiate a [Chat.Client](./chat-client.mdx) to subscribe to Chat events. 

:::info
For a full list of events that a [Chat.Client](./chat-client.mdx) can subscribe to, refer to [Chat Events](./chat-client.mdx#events).
:::

#### Example

The following example shows how to instantiate a [Chat.Client](./chat-client.mdx)
and [listen](./chat-client.mdx#listen) to the `onMemberJoined` event on the `channel1` channel.
When a member joins the channel,
the bot will send a message to the channel with the number of members in the channel and the list of members.

```javascript
import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/realtime-api";

const client = await SignalWire({ project: "ProjectID Here", token: "Token Here" })

const chatClient = client.chat;

await chatClient.listen({
  channels: ["channel1"],
  onMemberJoined: async (member) => {

    let members = await chatClient.getMembers({
      channel: member.channel
    });
    let chatMessage = `Hello ${member.id}!
    There are ${members.members.length} members in this channel.
    The members are: ${members.members.map(m => m.id).join(", ")}`

    await chatClient.publish({
      channel: member.channel,
      content: chatMessage
    })
  }
});
```
