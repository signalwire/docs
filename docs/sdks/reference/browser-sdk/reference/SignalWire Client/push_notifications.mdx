# Push Notifications

The SignalWire platform can be configured to send push notifications to a subscriber that is being called.
When the subscriber's device receives a push notification, it will make the device ring and forward the notification to your
application.
Your application should set up an audio/video link if the user accepts the call using the
[`handlePushNotification`](./client/index.mdx#handlepushnotification) method.
The push notification is only sent if there is no active WebSocket connection to the subscriber at that moment.

## Setup

To be able to receive push notifications to your applications, device-specific configurations are required.

For iOS, generate a [VoIP services certificate](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list)
from the Apple Developer website.

For Android, acquire the FCM API key. It can be found
at the Firebase project settings under Cloud Messaging tab. To get the API key, you might have to
explicitly enable "Cloud Messaging API (Legacy)".

:::info

There is no UI to upload the certificates for push to SignalWire yet. Please
get in touch with SignalWire support who'll promptly configure your account
with the certificates you want.

## Handling Push Notifications

The push notification is a compressed and encrypted JSON payload which contains the caller details
and the invitation that needs to be passed into the SDK to join the call.

To receive push notifications, after the app is configured with the certificates or tokens as
per device requirements, the device needs to be registered using the
[`client.registerDevice`](./client/index.mdx#registerdevice) method. The `registerDevice` method
expects a token, which the OS provides only if the user explicitly allows the app to receive
push notifications.

The `registerDevice` method, if successful, returns a push notification decryption key, which
must be saved and used to decrypt push notification messages as they are received.

### Payload

Each platform has its own schema but the core message has the following attributes:

| Name                   | Type     | Description                                                      |
| :--------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `encryption_type`      | `string` | Type of encryption used (`'aes_256_gcm'` or `'none'`)            |
| `notification_uuid`    | `string` | UUID of the push notification                                    |
| `with_video`           | `string` | Indicates whether the call includes video (`"true" \| "false"`)  |
| `incoming_caller_name` | `string` | Name of the incoming caller                                      |
| `incoming_caller_id`   | `string` | ID of the incoming caller                                        |
| `invite`               | `string` | Invitation (base 64 encoded, compressed, and possibly encrypted) |
| `title`                | `string` | Title of the call                                                |
| `type`                 | `string` | Type of notification (`'call_invite'`)                           |
| `iv`                   | `string` | The initialization vector of the encryption (base 64)            |
| `tag`                  | `string` | The tag info for the encryption (base 64)                        |
| `version`              | `string` | The version of the push notification received                    |

#### iOS

In iOS platform devices will wrap the payload in the following structure.

##### Payload

```json
{
  "aps": {
    "alert": {
      ...payload
    }
  }
}
```

On iOS, a special VoIP push notification will be sent which automatically invokes the
system's incoming call UI.

#### Android and Web Notifications

Android and web platforms will wrap the payload in the following structure.

##### Payload

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "body": "JSON stringified payload"
  },
  "data": {}
}
```

#### Handling the notification payload

Once the payload has been received, the `invite` needs to be decoded from Base64, decompressed, and decrypted
using the key received during device registration. Sample implementations in
[React Native](https://github.com/signalwire-community/react/blob/9bafa5ebec9dd3ade69ff4c97aec1a17269cdcf1/packages/react-native/src/SignalWire/useSignalWire.ts#L134)
and for [iOS](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire_flutter/blob/4035c73b718995eedaeb1087a778228fe7fa1bc5/packages/flutter_ios_voip_kit/ios/Classes/VoIPCenter.swift#L155)
are available.

Alternatively, a sample React Native project is available in the [community repo](https://github.com/signalwire-community/react/tree/main/demo/pushNotifications).
