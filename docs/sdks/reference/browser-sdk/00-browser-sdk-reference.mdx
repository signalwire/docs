Welcome to the technical documentation for the **JavaScript Browser SDK**.

:::info voice calls, dialing the PSTN, and connecting to SIP endpoints

This latest version of the RELAY Browser SDK is ideal for Chat applications and streaming or conferencing with audio and video.
If you need to add browser support for voice calls or dial the PSTN or SIP endpoints, please use our [previous version of the Browser SDK](https://docs.signalwire.com/reference/relay-sdk-js/v1/#relay-sdk-for-javascript).

## Get started

This SDK is meant to be used _in the browser_, and gives you access to four different namespaces:

- [Video](./video/index.mdx) gives you access to the classes and methods that let you interface with the backend Video APIs.
- [Chat](./chat/index.mdx) gives you access to the classes and methods that you need to create a real-time chat application.
- [PubSub](./pubsub/index.mdx) is the foundation layer of Chat. It gives you access to the most basic classes and functions to subscribe to channels, publish messages, and receive messages.
- [WebRTC](./webrtc/index.mdx) contains several functions that are useful for interacting with the hardware of the user's device.

Don't know where to start? Create an instance of [Video.RoomSession](./video/video-roomsession.mdx) to join a room, use the [Chat.Client](./chat/chat-client.mdx) constructor to start a chat application, or take a look at the [Simple Video Demo](/video/getting-started/simple-video-demo) or [Simple Chat Demo](../../../home/products/chat/getting-started/get-started-with-a-simple-chat-demo/index.mdx) walkthroughs.
