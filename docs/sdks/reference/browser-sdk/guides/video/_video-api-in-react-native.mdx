Introduction
------------

If you want to build a video-conferencing application on mobile, you can integrate the Video API inside any React Native application. In particular, you can use the [JavaScript Video SDK](/sdks/reference/browser-sdk) almost as you would on the web.


:::info Looking for the Technical SDK Reference?

Find it at the Browser SDK Reference [here](/sdks/reference/browser-sdk).

:::

In this guide, we will show you how to integrate the Video API into your React Native application. As a reference, you can take a look at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/signalwire/video-sdk-react-native-demo), which contains a demo videoconferencing application written in React Native. **Please note that currently the react-native support is experimental.** 

If you just want to try out the demo application, follow the instructions in the [README file](https://github.com/signalwire/video-sdk-react-native-demo).


:::info Prerequisites

In this guide we will assume a basic knowledge about our [JavaScript Video SDK](/sdks/reference/browser-sdk). If you want to know more about it, take a look at [Getting Started with the Video API](/video/getting-started/simple-video-demo) and then come back to follow this guide.

We will also assume some basic knowledge about React Native.

:::

Creating the application
------------------------

We are going to create a new React Native application. If you don't already have one, from the shell run:

```shell
npx react-native init MyMobileVideoApp
```

This will create a folder, MyMobileVideoApp, with some boilerplate code.

We need to install the following dependencies:

- **@signalwire/js**: the SignalWire Video SDK
- **react-native-webrtc**: WebRTC implementation for React Native
- **react-native-get-random-values**: a compatibility dependency
- **react-native-incall-manager**: to handle actions and events during a call as if it was a native one

```shell
cd MyMobileVideoApp
yarn add @signalwire/js react-native-webrtc react-native-incall-manager
```

For **iOS**, we also need to install the native modules:

```shell
cd ios
pod install
```

For **Android**, we need to increase the minSdkVersion from 21 to at least 24 (see [this upstream issue](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc/issues/720)). To do that, open the file `android/build.gradle` and set `minSdkVersion = 24`.

You can test the empty application with `npm run ios` or `npm run android`.

Setting up the permissions
--------------------------

Before delving into the code, we are going to configure our iOS and Android applications to require permissions for the camera and for the microphone.

#### iOS

For iOS, open the file `ios/MyMobileVideoApp/Info.plist` and add the following entries right before `<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow camera access so that others can see you during meetings</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow microphone access so that others can hear you during the meeting</string>
```

#### Android

For Android, open the file `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following entries:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
```

Adding basic video functionality
--------------------------------

We are going to add some basic video functionality to the `App.js` component. First, we import the libraries:

```javascript
import 'react-native-get-random-values';  // this must be imported at the very
                                          // top of the file, before any other
                                          // import

import * as SignalWire from '@signalwire/js';
import { RTCView } from 'react-native-webrtc';
import InCallManager from 'react-native-incall-manager';
```

Then, we add some state variables to our main component:

```javascript
const [stream, setStream] = React.useState(null);
const [roomSession, setRoomSession] = React.useState(null);
```

The `stream` variable will hold a reference to the remote stream, while `roomSession` will contain the RoomSession object from which we can access methods such as `audioMute()` and `videoMute()`.

Then, we are going to add to the template the WebRTC View in which the video stream will be displayed. Our template will be something like this, which also include a "Join" button:

```jsx
    <SafeAreaView>
      <RTCView
        streamURL={stream?.toURL?.()}
        style={{
          width: '100%',
          height: 300,
          backgroundColor: 'black'
        }} />
    </SafeAreaView>
    <Button onPress={join} title="Join" />
```

The "Join" button depends on a function `join`. This is mostly standard Video SDK code, and looks like this:

```javascript
async function join() {
  // We instantiate a room session. The user name and the room name are
  // determined by the token.
  const room = new SignalWire.Video.RoomSession({
    token: '<YourVideoRoomToken>',
    logLevel: 'silent'
  })

  // Store the room session object in the state of this component.
  setRoomSession(room)

  // Start the InCallManager to make the system know we are in a call.
  InCallManager.start({ media: 'audio' });

  // When we receive the event indicating that we have joined the session,
  // take the remote stream object and store it in the state variable.
  room.on('room.joined', params => {
    console.debug('>> EVENT room.joined', params);
    setStream(room.remoteStream);
  });

  // Actually join the room
  await room.join()
}
```

Note that we have left `<YourVideoRoomToken>` as a placeholder. To avoid over-complicating this guide, we will obtain a Video Room Token manually via cURL, and we will hardcode that into our component. In a real application, you would obtain the token from a remote server. Run from your shell the following cURL command to obtain the token:

```shell
curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://your_space_id.signalwire.com/api/video/room_tokens' \
     --user 'project_id:api_token' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{"user_name": "john", "room_name": "office"}'
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders `your_space_id`, `project_id`, and `api_token`, whose values you can find in your [SignalWire Space](https://signalwire.com/signin).

It's time to compile. Try building the application: you should be able to join a room.

Leaving the room
----------------

We are now going to add a new button to leave the room. Let's add a `leave` function to leave the session and to perform some cleanup:

```javascript
async function leave() {
  try {
    await roomSession?.leave();
    if (stream) {
      stream.release();
      setStream(null);
      setRoomSession(null);
      InCallManager.stop();
    }
  } catch (e) { }
}
```

Then we can use the function in a new button:

```jsx
<Button onPress={leave} title="Leave" />
```

At this point, our whole component should look like this:

```javascript
import 'react-native-get-random-values';

import React from 'react';
import {
  SafeAreaView,
  Button,
} from 'react-native';

import * as SignalWire from '@signalwire/js';
import { RTCView } from 'react-native-webrtc';
import InCallManager from 'react-native-incall-manager';

const App = () => {
  const [stream, setStream] = React.useState(null);
  const [roomSession, setRoomSession] = React.useState(null);

  async function join() {
    // We instantiate a room session. The user name and the room name are
    // determined by the token.
    const room = new SignalWire.Video.RoomSession({
      token: '<YourVideoRoomToken>',
      logLevel: 'silent'
    })

    // Store the room session object in the state of this component.
    setRoomSession(room)

    // Start the InCallManager to make the system know we are in a call.
    InCallManager.start({ media: 'audio' });

    // When we receive the event indicating that we have joined the session,
    // take the remote stream object and store it in the state variable.
    room.on('room.joined', params => {
      console.debug('>> EVENT room.joined', params);
      setStream(room.remoteStream);
    });

    // Actually join the room
    await room.join()
  }

  async function leave() {
    try {
      await roomSession?.leave();
      if (stream) {
        stream.release();
        setStream(null);
        setRoomSession(null);
        InCallManager.stop();
      }
    } catch (e) { }
  }

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <RTCView
        streamURL={stream?.toURL?.()}
        style={{
          width: '100%',
          height: 300,
          backgroundColor: 'black'
        }} />
      <Button onPress={join} title="Join" />
      <Button onPress={leave} title="Leave" />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Screen sharing
--------------

Screen sharing is also supported,
but it requires several additional steps for both Android and iOS.
Please refer to our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/signalwire/video-sdk-react-native-demo) for up-to-date instructions
on how to integrate screen sharing,
and for a working example.
