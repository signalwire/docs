## monitor_early_media_ring

string Monitors early media for a user-specific ring tone. Each time the tone is heard, the switch will increment an internal counter for that leg. Once the counter reaches `monitor_early_media_ring_total` (or this variable has not been set) then the early media will be sent.

The syntax is a series of `!` delimited early media conditions in the following format:

`condition_name:number_of_hits:tone_detect_frequencies`

| condition\_name           | user defined name for the error condition                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| number\_of\_hits          | the number of times the tone must be heard before considering it a fail                       |
| tone\_detect\_frequencies | the frequencies to listen for (delimited by + instead of ,). See [tone\_detect](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod-dptools/6586957.mdx#about) |

![(warning)](/images/icons/emoticons/warning.svg) this variable only works when `ignore_early_media` is set to true.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{monitor_early_media_ring_total=3,monitor_early_media_ring=usring:1:440.0+480.0!ukring:2:400+450}sofia/gateway/yourgateway/1239@conference.freeswitch.org"/>
```
