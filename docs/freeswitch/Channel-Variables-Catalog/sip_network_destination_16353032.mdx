## sip_network_destination

string It is intended for use with devices registering behind a NAT where the `Request-URI` should contain the contact that was bound to the AOR during the registration request while the request itself should be sent to the public IP and port number of the NAT "pinhole". It does not add a `Route` header field to the request like the `;fs_path=` or the [sip\_route\_uri](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#sip_route_uri) options do.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{sip_network_destination=sip:5551234567@66.243.109.243:10005}sofia/external/5551234567@172.16.110.45:5060"/>
```
