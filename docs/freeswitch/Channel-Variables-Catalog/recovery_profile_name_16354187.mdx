## recovery_profile_name

string It's used internally so the core recovery engine knows which profile name goes with the call. The profile name to the core is just an arbitrary sub category of the call where to [mod\_sofia](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod_sofia_1048707.mdx#about) it means the sip profile name. See [mailing list discussion](http://lists.freeswitch.org/pipermail/freeswitch-users/2012-December/090291.html).
