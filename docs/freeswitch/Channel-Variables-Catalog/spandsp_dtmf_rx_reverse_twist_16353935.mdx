## spandsp_dtmf_rx_reverse_twist

integer Sets the reverse twist setting in the spandsp DTMF detector. Reverse twist is set to 4 dB by default. This value can be safely increased up to 6 or 7 without a significant increase in talk-off to allow DTMFs that exceed this threshold to be detected. Set this variable prior to executing [spandsp\_start\_dtmf](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod_spandsp_6587021.mdx#dialplan-applications).

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="spandsp_dtmf_rx_reverse_twist=6"/>
<action application="spandsp_start_dtmf" />
```
