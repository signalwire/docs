## profile_created_time

integer Contains the start time (in microseconds) of when the call profile was created.

**Usage**

In the event that a call is transferred, this is the effective `created_time` for that transfer. For example, if you did this call flow:

```xml
2000 > 2001 (created_time=1357138714 / profile_created_time=1357138714)
transfer to 2002 (created_time=1357138714 / profile_created_time=1357138752)
transfer to 2003 (created_time=1357138714 / profile_created_time=1357138766)
transfer to 2004 (created_time=1357138714 / profile_created_time=1357138784)
```

You would still use [progress\_time](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#progress_time) to retrieve the progress start time, no matter if it's a transfer leg or not.
