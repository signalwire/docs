## sip_wait_for_aleg_ack

string When you set the variable `sip_wait_for_aleg_ack` on the b leg in the `{}` for the outbound call, this should make the B leg delay sending the `ACK` until it sees that the A leg has recv'd an ack.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{sip_wait_for_aleg_ack=true}sofia/internal/foo@bar.com"/>
```
