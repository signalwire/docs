## local_ip_v6

string

This global variable is set dynamically by the FreeSWITCH core by asking the underlying OS for the IPv6 address of the server on which FreeSWITCH is running (if it supports IPv6). If the server has multiple IPv6 addresses this will be set to the first one returned by the OS. In the [default configuration](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Configuration/Default-Configuration_6587388.mdx#mod_vp8) this variable is used for setting up IPv6 SIP and Verto Profiles.

You cannot override the value of this global variable, because it will be reset by the FreeSWITCH core every minute. If your server has multiple IPv6 addresses and you want to force FreeSWITCH to use a particular IPv6 address, you can create a global variable force\_local\_ip\_v6 and set it to the IP address you prefer. You must also set the local\_ip\_v6 variable to this IP address, you can do it by simply setting local\_ip\_v6 to use the value of force\_local\_ip\_v6.

**Example: force\_local\_ip\_v6**

```xml
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="force_local_ip_v4=1.1.1.1"/>
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="local_ip_v4=$${force_local_ip_v4 }"/>
```

FreeSWITCH will not validate that the IPv6 address you entered for `force_local_ip_v6` is actually pointing to the server, it's up to you to ensure that you use a valid IP address that's routed correctly to the server.
