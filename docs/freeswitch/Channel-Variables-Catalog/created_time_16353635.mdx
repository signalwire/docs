## created_time

string Contains the start time (in microseconds) of when the call was created.

In the event that a call is transferred, this will contain the time of when the entire call was created, not that specific transfer. If you need the transfer created time, see [profile\_created\_time](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#profile_created_time) and [variable\_progress\_time](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#leg_progress_timeout).
