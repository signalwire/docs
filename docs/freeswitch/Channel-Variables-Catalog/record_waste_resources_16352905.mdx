## record_waste_resources

string By default record doesn't send RTP packets. This is generally acceptable, but for longer recordings or depending on the RTP timer of your gateway, your channel may hangup with cause MEDIA\_TIMEOUT. Setting this variable will 'waste' bandwidth by sending RTP even during recording. The value can be `true`, `false`, or `[desired silence factor]`. By default the silence factor is 1400 if you set `record_waste_resources=true`.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="record_waste_resources=true"/>
```

```xml
<action application="set" data="record_waste_resources=1300"/>
```
