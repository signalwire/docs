## outbound_redirect_fatal

boolean When doing a simultaneous call to multiple endpoints, a 302 redirect can cause all the endpoints to stop ringing and the call will follow the redirect. When this channel variable is set it causes an endpoint that sends back a 302 redirect to be removed from the call list and the other endpoints continue to ring.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{outbound_redirect_fatal=true}${group_call(sales@$${domain})}"/>
```
