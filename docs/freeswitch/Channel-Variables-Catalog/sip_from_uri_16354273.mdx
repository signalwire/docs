## sip_from_uri

string The SIP URI of the endpoint sending the INVITE.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="export" data="sip_from_uri=${sip_from_uri}"/>
```

Some SIP providers insist on handling caller ID in a non-normal way. In most cases you can use [effective\_caller\_id\_name](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#effective_caller_id_name) and [effective\_caller\_id\_number](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#effective_caller_id_number) to set the caller ID on the outbound (B leg) of a bridged call. In some cases the SIP provider doesn't like that and may just show "anonymous" or some other default caller ID information.

The above example takes the From URI of an incoming SIP call and exports that value to the B leg. This is handy when you have a scenario like this:

```xml
Alice ==> FreeSWITCH bridge ==> Bob
```

You want Alice's caller ID information to be sent to Bob instead of FreeSWITCH's caller ID information. Usually this "just works" but if it doesn't you can try exporting sip\_from\_uri as above.
