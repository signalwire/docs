## conference_uuid

string Every instance of a conference has its own UUID. This channel variable stores the conference UUID for the most recent conference in which the channel was a member. It is set as soon as the channel enters the conference, and will show up in XML CDRs and uuid\_dump calls, as well as any events that show channel variables.
