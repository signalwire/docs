## fifo_member_wait

string If this variable is set to `wait`, the consumer's leg will not hangup when the caller hangs up. This is the default behavior.

If set to `nowait`, the consumer's leg will hangup when the caller hangs up.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="result=${fifo_member(add MyQueueName {fifo_member_wait=nowait}user/1001@VoiceNetwork.ca )"/>
```
