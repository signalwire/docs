## sip_copy_multipart

boolean FreeSWITCH supports only `INVITE`s with multipart bodies. FreeSWITCH does not support response messages such as `183 Session Progress` or `200 Ok` with multipart bodies. Typically SIP bodies only have one MIME part with an SDP using MIME type `application/sdp`. The SIP spec allows for multiple bodies defined with MIME type `multipart/mixed`. In this case FreeSWITCH will do it's best to find the MIME part with the SDP and parse that as it normally does. However, you can change FreeSWITCH behavior with multipart bodies and bridge using this variable.

![(info)](/images/icons/emoticons/information.svg) FreeSWITCH will "do the right thing" and attach an application/sdp type generated by FreeSWITCH (per your settings) for the B leg as it normally would. The other non-SDP MIME parts just pass through.

**Usage**

To have FreeSWITCH keep the multiple MIME parts intact when using bridge (default):

```xml
<action application="set" data="sip_copy_multipart=true"/>
```

To have FreeSWITCH strip the multiple MIME parts when using bridge:

```xml
<action application="set" data="sip_copy_multipart=false"/>
```
