## rtp_negotiate_near_match

boolean Setting this to true will cause FreeSWITCH to consider codec PTIME on inbound codec negotiation as well. If you receive a call with PCMU@30i and only have PCMU@20i on the list, it will prefer anything else that matches codec and ptime by default. This changes behavior and matches PCMU@30i despite the PTIME mismatch. This is only valid if you have other matching codecs on the endpoints lists, of course.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="rtp_negotiate_near_match=true"/>
```
