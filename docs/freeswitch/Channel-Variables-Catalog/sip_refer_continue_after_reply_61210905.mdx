## sip_refer_continue_after_reply

string Set `sip_refer_continue_after_reply` channel (or global) variable to `true` to enable, before sending REFER using deflect() or uuid\_deflect(). By default, FreeSWITCH will end the call after successfully sending out a REFER (with 200 OK in the body of subsequent NOTIFY messages)

When enabled, and when proxy-refer not in use, FreeSWITCH will process the REFER and set the final result in `sip_refer_target_status_code,`and provisional status in `sip_refer_target_provisional_status_code`. The call will stay up until explicitly ended.

  
Available since FreeSWITCH v1.10.7 release.

This is useful when testing rfc4579 REFER method to request a Focus to Add a New Resource to a Conference.
