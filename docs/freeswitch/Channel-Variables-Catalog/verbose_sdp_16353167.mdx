## verbose_sdp

boolean The RFCs require an rtpmap for IANA dynamic payload types. An rtpmap with codec name and payload type is not required for well known static payloads - (PCMU, PCMA, G729, etc).

By default FreeSWITCH sets `verbose_sdp=false` which doesn't include an rtpmap for static payload types. If your equipment doesn't support this (shame on them) set `verbose_sdp=true` which will include rtpmaps for any static payload types (previous default behavior).
