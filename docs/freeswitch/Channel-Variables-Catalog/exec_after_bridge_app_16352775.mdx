## exec_after_bridge_app

string Execute an application command after the bridge has been terminated. To be used with [exec\_after\_bridge\_arg](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#exec_after_bridge_arg). By contrast, to execute when the bridge has been established use [execute\_on\_answer](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#execute_on_answer).

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="exec_after_bridge_app=transfer"/>
<action application="set" data="exec_after_bridge_arg=2102"/>
```
