## sip_profile_name

string If your call is outbound, then this variable will contain the profile name used for the outbound channel (Leg B)

If the outbound channel is a gateway, then this variable will be set to `gateway`, and you'd need to look at `sip_gateway_name` to get the name of the gateway.

If the outbound channel is another profile, then this variable will be set to the name of that profile.

![(warning)](/images/icons/emoticons/warning.svg) This should NOT be confused with [sofia\_profile\_name](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#sofia_profile_name), which is the name of the profile for Leg A.

**Usage**

Call from user on internal profile, routed out via gateway "ntl":

```xml
sip_profile_name=gateway
sip_gateway_name=ntl
sofia_profile_name=internal
```

Call from user on internal profile, routed out via internal profile:

```xml
sip_profile_name=internal
sip_gateway_name=
sofia_profile_name=internal
```

Call from user on external profile, routed out via internal profile:

```xml
sip_profile_name=internal
sip_gateway_name=
sofia_profile_name=external
```
