## origination_cancel_key

dtmf digit Used with attended transfer function. Allows you to set a DTMF key that will cancel the att\_xfer and re-connect to the call on hold. It'll also cancel a bridge that hasn't been bridged as yet (and thus can't be terminated with a [bridge\_terminate\_key](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#bridge_terminate_key)). Implemented in revision 14650.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="origination_cancel_key=#"/>
```
