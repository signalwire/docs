## bridge_pre_execute_bleg_app

string Command or api to be executed on the B leg before bridging the two channels. Useful when originating a call from the event socket, CLI or XML-RPC.

It could for instance be used to do a HTTP GET with a script or mod\_http to the IP address of a Snom phone to increase the ringer volume if you need to do a wakeup call.

Can also be used to bind a dtmf to an app on the b leg of a call so that it can survive a transfer.

Arguments can be passed to the app with [bridge\_pre\_execute\_bleg\_data](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#bridge_pre_execute_bleg_data).

![(warning)](/images/icons/emoticons/warning.svg) this is executed AFTER the call is setup but BEFORE the media (audio) is bridged.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="bridge_pre_execute_bleg_app=bind_meta_app"/>
<action application="set" data="bridge_pre_execute_bleg_data=1 a s att_xfer::sofia/profile/destination"/>
```
