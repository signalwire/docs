## conference_enforce_security

boolean Allows the conference security to be overridden. This applies in two different scenarios, one for inbound and one for outbound. By default, conference security is always applied to inbound calls and is always skipped for outbound calls. This channel variable allows the behavior to be modified.

**Usage**

Inbound:

```xml
<action application="set" data="conference_enforce_security=false"/>
<action application="conference" data="3000"/>
```

Outbound:

```xml
originate {conference_enforce_security=true}sofia/internal/1001 &conference(3000)
```
