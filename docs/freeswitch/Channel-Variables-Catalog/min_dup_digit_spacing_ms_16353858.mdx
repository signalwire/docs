## min_dup_digit_spacing_ms

integer Duplicate inband DTMF that starts sooner than this time will be ignored. That is, this is the minimum gap from the end of the first digit and the start of the repeated digit required for two digits to be detected. This value is `0` by default. Set this variable prior to executing [spandsp\_start\_dtmf](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Modules/mod_spandsp_6587021.mdx#dialplan-applications).

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="min_dup_digit_spacing_ms=40"/>
<action application="spandsp_start_dtmf" />
```
