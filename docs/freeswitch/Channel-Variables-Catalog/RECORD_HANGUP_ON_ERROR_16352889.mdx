## RECORD_HANGUP_ON_ERROR

boolean When set to `true` this channel variable will cause the call to hangup if there is an error when trying to record the call. This is not a common feature, however in cases where a call MUST be recorded it makes it impossible to have calls that are not recorded. (Useful in some business scenarios.)

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="RECORD_HANGUP_ON_ERROR=true"/>
```
