## sip_to_port

string Port part of the `To` SIP header.

**Usage**

If your request header contains:

```xml
To: <sip:1000@server.example.com:5661>;tag=0e70ba56
```

Then the value for this field would be:

```xml
5661
```

However, if your request header does not contain a port, then the value for this field would be your default SIP port (usually 5060):

```xml
To: <sip:1000@server.example.com>;tag=0e70ba56
```
