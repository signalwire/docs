## max_session_transfers

INTEGER Allows to separate counting transfers from `max_forwards`.

Normally, when `transfer` application is invoked, `max_forwards` is decremented.

When `max_session_transfers` variable is set in a channel, `max_forwards` is not touched when `transfer` application is invoked and `max_session_transfers` value is decremented instead.

This can be used to prevent calls going on-hook in larger IVR applications when many transfers are expected.
