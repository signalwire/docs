## transfer_ringback

string This is the sound that will play if a call has already been answered, and it is then transferred to another endpoint. The syntax is the same as [ringback](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#transfer_ringback).

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="transfer_ringback=${fr-ring}"/>
```
