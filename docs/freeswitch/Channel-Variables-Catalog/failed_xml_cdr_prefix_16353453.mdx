## failed_xml_cdr_prefix

string If you set that on the A leg and any and all failed B originates generate a full XML CDR report and set it as a variable, this includes during a forked dial.

So say you try to call `sofia/profile/a@xxxxxxx,sofia/profile/b@xxxxxxx`.

And it fails completely, before you make the call you set `failed_xml_cdr_prefix` to "bad\_call".

Then you end up with `${bad_call_1}` and `${bad_call_2}` which are each a full XML report including all the vars etc.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="failed_xml_cdr_prefix=failinggw" />
```
