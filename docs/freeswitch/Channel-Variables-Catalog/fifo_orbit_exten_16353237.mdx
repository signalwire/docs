## fifo_orbit_exten

string

Syntax: `exten:timeout`

Set a destination extension and timeout, and it will cause FreeSWITCH to run the caller through the FIFO until the specified timeout, then the caller will get transferred to the destination extension. Can be set before launching the caller into the FIFO.

**Usage**

Before executing the `fifo` application:

```xml
<action application="set" data="fifo_orbit_exten=MyFIFOVoicemail:60"/>
```

Now after 60 seconds of waiting in the FIFO, the caller will be transferred to `MyFIFOVoicemail`.

```xml
<action application="fifo" data="MyFIFO in"/>
```
