## origination_uuid

string You can specify the uuid of an originated call using `origination_uuid`. This way you can hang up the call before it is answered, since you know the uuid. Just remember you need to use the `create_uuid` command to generate the uuid as 2 calls with the same uuid == bad!

![(info)](/images/icons/emoticons/information.svg) Bridge also uses the origination syntax so you can also pre-allocate the UUID for the new channel resulting from a bridge by using the `{}`/`[]` syntax and specifying `origination_uuid` there, too.

**Usage**

```xml
originate [origination_uuid=....]sofia/<profile>/<extension>
```
