## accountcode

string Account code is mostly an arbitrary value that you can assign on a per leg basis. An important feature of accountcode is that if its value matches one of the CDR CSV templates defined in `cdr_csv.conf.xml` then that CDR template will be used when generating a CSV CDR.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="accountcode=custom"/>
```
