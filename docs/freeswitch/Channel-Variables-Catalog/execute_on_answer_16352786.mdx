## execute_on_answer

string Execute an application (not an api) when the called party answers. To set an api, use [api\_on\_answer](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#api_on_answer). `execute_on_answer` will also allow for more control when dealing with no answer conditions in cases where you cannot ignore early media.

The command is executed only on channels that are not already answered. Just use `export` or `export` with `nolocal:` prefix to make sure it is executed when b-leg answers.

In the second usage example below, we have originated an outbound call to a local extension, where we will wait 30 seconds while manually ignoring media. In this case we use `set` and not `export`.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="export" data="nolocal:execute_on_answer=lua incrInUse.lua ${uuid}"/>
```

To wait 30 seconds for an answer while 'manually' ignoring early media:

```xml
originate {ignore_early_media=true}sofia/gateway/my_gateway/5551212 885551212
```

```xml
<extension name="exe_on_ans">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^88(\d+)$">
    <action application="set" data="execute_on_answer=transfer ANSWEREDCALL XML default"/>
    <action application="log" data="INFO Waiting 30 seconds for $1 to answer..."/>
    <action application="sleep" data="30000"/>
    <action application="log" data="INFO Call to $1 was not answered, taking alternative action..."/>
    <action application="transfer" data="UNANSWEREDCALL XML default"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```
