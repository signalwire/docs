## effective_caller_id_name

string Sets the effective callerid name. This is automatically exported to the B-leg; however, it is not valid in an origination string. In other words, set this before calling bridge, otherwise use [origination\_caller\_id\_name](../FreeSWITCH-Explained/Dialplan/Variables-Master-List_16352570.mdx#origination_caller_id_name).

Snom 370/820

If you want to display LEG A's name (if available) as soon as LEG B (here the local Snom) rings, you have to set `origination_caller_id_name` or `effective_caller_id_name` as described. Otherwise, in LEG B's display, you will see LEG A's number during ringing and switching to LEG A's name after picking up the call by LEG B. To remove it set it to `_undef_`.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="effective_caller_id_name=Bob Smith"/>
```
