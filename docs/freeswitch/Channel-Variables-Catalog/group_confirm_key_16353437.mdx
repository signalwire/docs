## group_confirm_key

dtmf digit In the `group_confirm_key` variable, you define the DTMF that the called party should send to FS to bridge the call. If a wrong DTMF or no DTMF is sent, the called won't be bridged and the wav file will be repeated.

**Usage**

```xml
<action application="set" data="group_confirm_key=1" />
```
