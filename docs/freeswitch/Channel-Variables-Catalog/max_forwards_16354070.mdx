## max_forwards

integer Contains the current `Max-Forwards` value provided in the originating request. The `Max-Forwards` value is decremented by one for each hop in a SIP call, when the `Max-Forwards` value is depleted the receiving agent must not pass the call onwards.

The `max_forwards` variable may be set on an outbound channel, some providers such as BT IP Exchange insist on a minimum value to faithfully terminate the call, 50 in BT's case.

![(warning)](/images/icons/emoticons/warning.svg) If the `max_forwards` value is reset it can cause potential cyclic calls between two operators who loop calls back to each other in error. Use wisely.

**Usage**

Bridge an incoming call to a provider requiring a minimum `Max-Forwards` value:

```xml
<action application="bridge" data="{max_forwards=65}sofia/gateway/ipexchange/442920180123"/>
```
