## sip_request_port

string Port part of the SIP header.

**Usage**

If your request header starts with:

```xml
REGISTER sip:172.16.44.8:5061 SIP/2.0
```

Then the value of this field would be:

```xml
5061
```

However, if your request header does not contain a port, then the value for this field would be your default SIP port (usually 5060):

```xml
REGISTER sip:172.16.44.8 SIP/2.0
```
