### Presence

In order to enable Subscriptions, add the following line to the profile settings.

```xml
<param name="manage-presence" value="true"/>
```

### Sending Events

Notifications can be sent to the user in all the same ways that other events can be. (i.e. js, socket, etc).

### MWI if you are using FreeSWITCH as a voicemail server, but registering to OpenSIPS etc

All you have to do is setup OpenSIPS to relay the SUBSCRIBE messages to FreeSWITCH and it just works.
