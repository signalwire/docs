### Download Xcode (No Longer Required as of December 2017)

Xcode takes a while to download and is placed into the Applications folder (/Applications directory) with the **C**ommand **L**ine **T**ools in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer.

This Xcode Download requires you to sign in with your Apple ID and agree to the Software Agreement:  
El Capitan 10.11: download and install Xcode 7.3.1 from [Xcode 7.3.1 Download](https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer%5FTools/Xcode%5F7.3.1/Xcode%5F7.3.1.dmg) then start Xcode. NOTE: Xcode 8 CANNOT be used. See [FS-9521](https://freeswitch.org/jira/browse/FS-9521).

For OS X 10.11 and 10.12: NEVER delete the /usr/local directory! It's very difficult to recreate, it must be restored from a backup. This is due to [System Integrity Protection (aka rootless)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System%5FIntegrity%5FProtection) security.

As of July 17, 2016, the page below is no longer maintained by the original author and is marked as archived. It is replaced by these instructions: [macOS Developer Tools](../macOS-Installation/index.mdx#installation-methods).

## About

This is part of the [macOS Installation](../macOS-Installation/index.mdx#about) guide for installing and running FreeSWITCH™. This page describes the installation of components that may be unique to OS X 10.11**.**

## OS X Developer Tools

The OS X Developer Tools are composed of two parts, the [Xcode 7](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html) OS X Software Developer Kit used to develop and test OS X GUI applications, and the **C**ommand **L**ine **T**ools that provide [LLVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM), [Clang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang), [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git%5F%28software%29) and other tools required to generate non-GUI applications such as FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisites. The Command Line Tools are included and automatically installed with Xcode. The Apple Developer site offers the **standalone CLT** but it _**cannot be used because Homebrew will not install without the** **Xcode/CLT version.**_

### Install Xcode

Install Xcode using the [OS X App Store application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) or download it from the [OS X Developer site](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action) which requires a minimum of a free membership. Xcode takes a while to download and is placed into the Applications folder (/Applications directory) with the CLT in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer. _**Once installed start Xcode to accept the license agreement.**_
