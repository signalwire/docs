## About

This is part of the [macOS Installation](../macOS-Installation/index.mdx#about) guide for installing and running FreeSWITCH™. This page describes the installation of components that may be unique to OS X 10.9**.**

## OS X Developer Tools

The OS X Developer Tools are composed of two parts, the [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html) OS X Software Developer Kit used to develop and test OS X GUI applications, and the **C**ommand **L**ine **T**ools that provide [LLVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM), [Clang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang), [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git%5F%28software%29) and other tools required to generate non-GUI applications such as FreeSWITCH™ and its prerequisites. The Command Line Tools are included and automatically installed with Xcode. The Apple Developer site offers the **standalone CLT** but it _**cannot be used because Homebrew will not install without the** **Xcode/CLT version.**_

### Install Xcode 6

Xcode 6.2 is no longer available from the [OS X App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) so must be downloaded from the [OS X Developer site](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action) which requires a minimum of a free membership. Xcode takes a while to download and is placed into the Applications folder (/Applications directory) with the CLT in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer. _**Once installed start Xcode to accept the license agreement.**_
