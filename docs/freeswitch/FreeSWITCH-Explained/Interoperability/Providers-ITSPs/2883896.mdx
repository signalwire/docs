* * Vonage normally doesn't offer a SIP service, but they do offer through resellers a product called "Vonage Business Plus", you can do some Google searches to find a reseller fairly easily.  
   * Added the following in _conf/sip\_profiles/external/vonage.xml_

```xml
 <include>
  <gateway name="sphone1.voncp.com">
    <param name="username" value="15555551212"/> 
    <param name="password" value="<Your Password>"/>-->
    <param name="extension-in-contact" value="true"/>
  </gateway>
</include>
```

Note that **extension-in-contact** is necessary to ensure that the username is provided in the Contact: header. If this is missing, the BYE message sent in response to a challenge from the Vonage softphone proxy will fail, and the call won't be dropped until the far end drop the call. On some SIP messages (like the BYE message), the username field **must** be present in the Contact header.
