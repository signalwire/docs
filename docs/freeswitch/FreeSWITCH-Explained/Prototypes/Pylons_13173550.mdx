[Pylons](http://pylonshq.com/) is a Python based webserver. Together with [mod\_xml\_curl](../Modules/mod_xml_curl_1049001.mdx) it makes setting up FS reasonably straight forward. The examples on this page are not for a producting server, but should serve as a starting point for "playing" with FS.

* Installation of Pylons:

```xml
Debian: apt-get install pylons
```

Pylons comes with paster, it is a rather useful program that allows you to setup a pylons project and also acts as a small webserver --- which is ideal for testing.

* Creation of pylons project:

```xml
paster create -t pylons freeswitch
```

That creates a new project in your current folder. The parts of pylons which will hold the code to interact with FS are called controllers and they are created as follows.

* Controller creation:

```xml
paster controller freeswitchdialplan
paster controller freeswitchdirectory
paster controller freeswitchcdr
```

These three controllers can be found in:

```xml
freeswitch/controllers/
```

Now get the FS code from svn for the controllers and add replace the ones we have just created:

```xml
svn checkout http://svn.freeswitch.org/svn/freeswitch/trunk/scripts/contrib/Phil/pylons/
```

Pylons is now ready and all you need to do is to start it, go to the main pylons directory that contains development.ini and test.ini, and do:

```xml
paster serve --reload development.ini
```

Now your pylons webserver should be running on port 5000\. The --reload flag performs an auto reload anytime you update your controllers.

On to FS. In order to get FS to talk to pylons we need to set a couple of parameters.

  
When compiling FS make sure you have enabled the following two options in modules.conf:

```xml
xml_int/mod_xml_curl
xml_int/mod_xml_cdr
```

conf/autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml:

```xml
<load module="mod_xml_curl"/>
<load module="mod_xml_cdr"/>
```

conf/autoload\_configs/xml\_curl.conf.xml:

```xml
<configuration name="xml_curl.conf" description="cURL XML Gateway">
     <bindings>
       <binding name="dialplan fetcher">
         <param name="gateway-url" value="http://127.0.0.1:5000/freeswitchdialplan/dialplan" bindings="dialplan"/>
       </binding>
       <binding name="directory">
         <param name="gateway-url" value="http://127.0.0.1:5000/freeswitchdirectory/directory" bindings="directory"/>
       </binding>
     </bindings>
</configuration>
```

conf/autoload\_configs/xml\_cdr.conf.xml:

```xml
<param name="url" value="http://127.0.0.1:5000/freeswitchcdr/cdr"/>
```

  
Now FS should get dialplan, directory and cdr info from pylons. If you got any further questions please find me on irc: phm\_it
