## 0\. About

Flushes DTMFs received on a channel. Useful in cases where callers may have entered extra digits in one dialog and you want to flush them out before sending them into another dialog. (See [mod\_dptools: play\_and\_get\_digits](./6586933.mdx#about)).

## 1\. Usage

```xml
<action application="flush_dtmf"/>
```

If you have issues with mysterious DTMFs being entered in your dialogs then try adding '''flush\_dtmf''' before the dialog and see if that helps.
