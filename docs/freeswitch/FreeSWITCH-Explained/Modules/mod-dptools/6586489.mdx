# mod_dptools: bridge export 

 

## About

  
Export a channel variable across any bridge.This application differs from export in that it works with \*any\* kind of bridge, not just a bridge called from the dialplan. For example, bridge\_export will export its variables across a uuid\_transfer whereas export will not.

  
## Usage

```xml
<action application="bridge_export" data="foo=bar"/>
```

You should then be able to see the following in both a-leg and b-leg after the bridge app is executed:

[variable_bridge_export_vars] = [foo]  
[variable_foo] = [bar]

  
Like [export](./6586592.mdx#about), to restrict the export only to the B leg, use the 'nolocal:' flag, like below:

```xml
<action application="bridge_export" data="nolocal:foo=bar"/>
```
