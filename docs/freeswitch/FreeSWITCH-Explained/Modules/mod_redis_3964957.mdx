## About

mod\_redis supplies a call-limiting back-end that uses Redis.

**Note:** This backend does NOT support rate based limits.

## Setup and Configuration

Download [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/downloads/list) and install it per the instructions. (As of this writing 2.0 was still in RC so I used 1.2)

```xml
tar zxvf redis-1.2.6.tar.gz
cd redis-1.2.6
make
```

After make, open a second window and then launch the redis-server script Back in the redis source directory launch:

```xml
make test
```

This will test your redis system.

In the FreeSWITCH source directory be sure that mod\_redis is enabled in modules.conf, then build:

```xml
make mod_redis-install
```

Copy the redis.conf.xml file into conf/autoload\_configs/ Then load:

```xml
reloadxml
load mod_redis
```

Add mod\_redis to conf/autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml to make it load automatically when FreeSWITCH starts.

## Usage

Redis is used like any other limit back-end:

```xml
<action application="limit" data="redis realm id 10 limit_exceeded" />
```
