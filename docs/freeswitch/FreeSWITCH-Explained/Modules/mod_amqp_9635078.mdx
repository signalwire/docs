## Loading

Once you have installed FreeSWITCH from packages, configure FreeSWITCH to load mod\_amqp in autoload\_configs/modules.conf.xml by uncommenting the line:

```xml
<load module="mod_amqp"/>
```

## Configuring

If need be, edit the amqp connection configuration in autoload\_configs/amqp.conf.xml and set the hostname, username, password, and port as applicable.

Example for default installation where rabbitmq server is the same as the FreeSWITCH server:

```xml
<profile name="default">
  <connections>
    <connection name="primary">
     <param name="hostname" value="localhost"/>
     <param name="virtualhost" value="/"/>
     <param name="username" value="guest"/>
     <param name="password" value="guest"/>
     <param name="port" value="5672"/>
     <param name="heartbeat" value="0"/>
   </connection>
...
```

Customize the Event Filter by editing the following lines. The default captures channel create and destroy, fs heartbeat, and dtmf.

```xml
 <!--    <param name="eventFilter" value="SWITCH_EVENT_ALL"/> -->
 <param name="event_filter" value="SWITCH_EVENT_CHANNEL_CREATE,SWITCH_EVENT_CHANNEL_DESTROY,SWITCH_EVENT_HEARTBEAT,SWITCH_EVENT_DTMF"/>
```

From fs\_cli, apply the changes:

```xml
 reloadxml
 reload mod_amqp
```
