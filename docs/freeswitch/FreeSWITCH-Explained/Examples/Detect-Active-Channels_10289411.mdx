Methods to list active call sessions.

Even more efficient is to subscribe to the HEARTBEAT, as it has the session count in there. This fires every few seconds.

For LUA it's (FS 1.6):

**Lua active channel display**

```xml
api = freeswitch.API();
num_channels = api:executeString("show channels count");
digits = api:execute("regex", num_channels  .. "|/([0-9]*)/|$1");
freeswitch.consoleLog("info", "num channels is: " .. digits .. "\n")
```

to get the number of active channels.

## XML Dialplan

In the XML Dialplan it could be done like this:

```xml
<action application="set" data="foo=${regex(${show channels count}|/([0-9]*)/|%1)}"/>
<action application="log" data="INFO foo: ${foo}" />
```

Note: If you only want outbound calls you could try:

show channels like external 

as the command, you then however must have a SIP profile that is only for outbound (in this case named 'external').
