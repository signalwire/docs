## Profiles

mod\_rtmp allows you to listen on multiple profiles. Each profile binds to a unique IP:port combination (similar to [Sofia](../Configuration/Sofia-SIP-Stack/index.mdx#faq) profiles). Each profile can be configured with different settings.

This allows you to either listen for calls on multiple addresses/ports, or provide different connection settings to different users depending on which profile they connect to.

### Basic settings

#### bind-address

```xml
<param name="bind-address" value="0.0.0.0:1935" />
```

This sets the address and port to bind to and listen for connections on. It can bind to 0.0.0.0 (i.e. all addresses).

#### context

```xml
<param name="context" value="public" />
```

This sets the dialplan context to process the call in.

#### dialplan

```xml
<param name="dialplan" value="XML" />
```

This sets the dialplan provider to use, usually XML.

#### auth-calls

```xml
<param name="auth-calls" value="true" />
```

This controls whether unauthenticated calls are allowed. If set to true only authenticated calls can be made.

#### buffer-len

```xml
<param name="buffer-len" value="50" />miliseconds
```

This controls how much time to buffer the media to the client for, in milliseconds.

#### chunksize

```xml
<param name="chunksize" value="512" />
```

This sets the maximum size of outbound RTMP chunks.
