## What is MRCP?

[MRCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media%5FResource%5FControl%5FProtocol) is a protocol for PBX's to communicate with ASR and TTS engines. In version 1 of the MRCP spec, RTSP is used for session setup and RTP used for media streaming, whereas in version 2 of the MRCP spec, SIP is used instead of RTSP for session setup (RTP still used for media streaming).

## Current Status

UniMRCP is currently stable. Version 1.0.0 was released in June 2010.

Supports both v1 and v2 of the MRCP protocol.
