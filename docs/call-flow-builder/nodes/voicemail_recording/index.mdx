# Voicemail Recording

This node uses the asynchronous recording method to record a voicemail.
Reference the recording URL in other nodes in the Flow using the variable `%{record_url}`.
You can also access the recording URL from the call log details in your [RELAY Space](https://my.signalwire.com?page=relay).

## **Examples**


### Simple voicemail with goodbye message

For a traditional voicemail experience, we recommend pairing the Voicemail Recording node with a 
[Play Audio or TTS](/call-flow-builder/play-audio-or-tts) node and including a beep before recording. 
Including a terminator (in this case, a `#` sign) will allow nodes to run after the caller is finished leaving their voicemail.

### Record voicemail and send recording URL as a POST request

You can pair this node with a [Request](../request/index.mdx) node to send the recording URL to the webhook of your choice. 
Please note that any later recordings in the Flow will overwrite the `%{record_url}` variable,
so the Request node should immediately follow this Voicemail Recording node or use 
[Set Variables](../set_variables/index.mdx) to save this URL for a later request.

### Record voicemail and send recording URL as SMS

You may want to be notified about a new voicemail with an SMS. 
You can follow the Voicemail Recording node with a Send SMS node and again access call data and the recording URL with 
the `{call.}` and `{record_url}` variables.
