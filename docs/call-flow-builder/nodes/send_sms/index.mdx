# Send SMS

The Send SMS node is used to send an SMS to a phone number.


## **Node Settings**

| Node Setting      | Description                                       |
|:------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| To Phone Number   | The phone number to which the SMS will be sent.   |
| From Phone Number | The phone number from which the SMS will be sent. |
| SMS Text          | The text of the SMS that will be sent.            |


## **Example**

### Send SMS with variable

The example below is connected with a Request node that sends a request to a joke API. 
Knowing the parameters of the API response, the node can pull the request’s response with `%{request_response.joke}`. 
This example also includes messaging opt-out verbiage since this is important to avoid SMS spam blocks.

### Send SMS notification as Call Whisper

You might be using Call Flow Builder to forward calls to a personal cell phone. The example below will send an SMS to the specified phone number just before forwarding a call to that same number. This way you’ll receive a text letting you know this is a forwarded call from SignalWire and which original SignalWire number your caller dialed.
