# Stop Call Recording

Stops the specified recording action. 
Reference the recording URL in other nodes in the Flow using the variable `%{record_call_url}`.
You can also access the recording URL from the call log details in your [RELAY Space](https://my.signalwire.com/?page=relay).


## **Node Settings**

| Node Setting   | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recording Name | The name of the recording to stop. This should be connected to a [Start Call Recording](../start_call_recording/index.mdx) node and match the recording name. |

---

## **Example**

You can pair this node with a [Request](../request/index.mdx) node to send the recording URL to the webhook of your choice. 

Please note that any later recordings in the Flow will overwrite the `%{record_call_url}` variable, 
so the Request node should immediately follow this Stop Call Recording node or use 
[Set Variables](../set_variables/index.mdx) to save this URL for a later request.
