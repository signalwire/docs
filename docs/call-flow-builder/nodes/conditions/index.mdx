# Conditions

A Conditions node works like a 
[JavaScript if statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling#if...else_statement). 

A condition field can reference variables that have been set in the flow with `%{Key}`, 
Request node responses accessed with `%{request_response.<object_field>}`,
or call parameters such as `%{call.from}`.
Add additional conditions to create `else if` conditions.

The "Cond #" path will be executed for a truthy condition. The "Else" path will be executed for a falsy condition.

| **Else**      | The path to take if none of the conditions are met.                                                                                                                                                            |

## Example

### Use conditions to create a block list

In this example, we immediately hang up calls from specific numbers on our block list and forward call from a VIP directly to our administration number. 
All other calls will connect to the main reception number.
