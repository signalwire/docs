# Handle Call

The `Handle Call` node is used to handle an incoming call.
It is the first node in the call flow, does not have an input connector and is mandatory in every call flow.
The `Handle Call` node cannot be deleted from the call flow and an additional `Handle Call` node cannot be added to the call flow.
The first node connected to the Handle Call node is the starting point of the call flow.

## **Node Settings**

## **Example**

In the example below, the `Handle Call` node is connected to the `Answer Call` node, which is the starting point of the call flow.
After the call is answered, the call flow continues with the `Play Audio or TTS` node to play a TTS message to the caller.
