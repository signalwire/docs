`Contexts` in Call Fabric define the operational environment or 'scenario' under which [resources](#resources) operate.
They determine how resources are routed and interact with each other.

Every Space has two contexts:

- The `public` context exposes the Resource to anyone.
- The `private` context exposes the Resource to Subscribers.
