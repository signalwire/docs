`Contexts` in Call Fabric define the operational environment or 'scenario' under which 
[Resources](/platform/call-fabric/resources) operate.
They determine how resources are routed and interact with each other.

Every Space has two contexts:

- The `public` context exposes the Resource to anyone.
- The `private` context exposes the Resource to Subscribers.

Use Contexts to structure and secure your communication flows
with granular control over how different elements within the Call Fabric interact and are exposed.
