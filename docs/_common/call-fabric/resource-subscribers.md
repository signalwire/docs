Subscribers represent **registered end-users** within the Call Fabric paradigm.
In other words, subscribers are internal account-holders.
As such, they always use the `private` context.

Subscribers are the focal points of communication, capable of receiving or initiating calls, messages, and other forms of interaction.
The system facilitates smooth transitions between different communication modes,
such as switching from a voice call to a video conference, or from a text chat to a voice call.

This offers a seamless user experience by allowing easy switching between different communication channels,
and improves accessibility and convenience by catering to the preferences and needs of different users.
