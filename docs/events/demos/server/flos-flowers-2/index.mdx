#### SignalWire's AI Agent Meets OpenAI's DALL¬∑E 3

This SignalWire AI flower sending bot sends an eCard image (MMS/SMS) along with a text message.

The Flo's Flowers 2.0 uses SignalWire's AI Gateway (SWAIG) and the creative power of OpenAI's DALL-E 3 to send personalized virtual flowers.

## How it works

The **Flo's Flowers 2.0** demo has 3 primary interfaces:

 - The **AI agent**, made available by phone call on the PSTN by SignalWire
 - A **public website** showing live flower request details and the generated DALL¬∑E images
 - **SMS and MMS messages** delivered to the user with the generated images and confirmation details

## Build it

In addition to what is included in the 
[**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/signalwire/digital_employees/tree/main/server/Perl_Examples/FlosFlowers2), 
you will also need to set up the following components.

  - **Web server:** NGINX
  - **Database:** For this example, we'll be using PostgreSQL to store records about flower requests
  - **Active SignalWire Space:** Accessed at `yourspace.signalwire.com`
  - **Signalwire API token**
  - **A registered/apporoved campaign for SMS** in your SignalWire Space
  - **OpenAI API Key** for DALL-E 3 image generation

:::info
SMS is subject to additional regulation by carriers. If you haven't worked with SMS before, check out our comprehensive guide to [navigating the Campaign Registry process](https://developer.signalwire.com/guides/campaign-registry-all-you-need-to-know/).

### Function reference

See the below table to learn more about the necessary functions and arguments for the demo application,
and how they contribute to overall functionality.

| Function       | Arguments                              | Description                                                             |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `send_flowers` | `to`, `from`, `flower_type`, `message` | Utilizes SWAIG for sending virtual flowers with a personalized message. |

#### The `send_flowers` function

The `send_flowers` function is central to the Flo's Flowers 2.0 demo.
This function utilizes **SWAIG** (the **S**ignal**W**ire **AI** **G**ateway) to connect your SignalWire configuration to OpenAI and DALL¬∑E. 

This table represents the arguments required by the `send_flowers` function to execute its task.

| Argument     | Type   | Description                                                                                                                            |
| :----------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `to`         | String | The phone number of the recipient. This must include the country code to ensure the message is correctly routed to the intended party. |
| `from`       | String | The phone number associated with the SignalWire account sending the virtual flowers. This number acts as the sender ID in the message. |
| `flowertype` | String | Specify the type of flowers to be generated by the DALL-E 3 model. Get creative!                                                       |
| `message`    | String | A personalized message to accompany the virtual flower image.                                                                          |

The `send_flowers` function leverages both SignalWire's messaging capabilities and the innovative image generation of OpenAI's DALL-E 3 
to create and send a unique virtual flower arrangement with a customized message.
