# Authorization

Most SignalWire REST API endpoints require authentication using [HTTP Basic
Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). HTTP Basic
Authentication requires you to send an `Authorization` header of your Project ID
and Authentication Token. This should be supported in almost all HTTP clients.

Each project has its own Project ID and Authentication Tokens you will need to
use when making each request to the API. You can find your Project ID and
Authentication Tokens in your SignalWire Dashboard.

## Example

```bash title="cURL"
curl https://demo.signalwire.com/api/video/rooms \
      -u 'YourProjectID:YourAuthToken'
```

Note that cURL uses the `-u` option to pass in HTTP Basic Auth credentials to
the request. These are your Project ID and Auth Tokens, which you can find in
your SignalWire Dashboard.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.
API requests without authentication will also fail.
