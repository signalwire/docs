A Campaign belongs to a Brand.

To create a new managed campaign, send a POST request to the Campaign
resource with all of the parameters except for
`csp_campaign_reference`.

To create a new self-registered campaign, send a POST request to the
same Campaign resource except that you only need to fill out the
`name` and `csp_campaign_reference` parameters.

*Please note: the `csp_self_registered` parameter has been deprecated
and is no longer required.*

#### Permissions
The API token must include the following scopes: _Messaging_.
