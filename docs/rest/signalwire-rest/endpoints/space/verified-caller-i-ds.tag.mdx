This is an object that represents a phone number that is not purchased through SignalWire. In order place a call from a phone number not purchased through SignalWire, you must first verify that you are the owner of that number. For more information on Verified Caller IDs you can [read about them](https://signalwire.com/blogs/product/verified-caller-id-local-number-portability).

### How This Works
In order to use a number that you have not purchased through SignalWire as a Caller ID, value you must first verify that you own that number. You are limited to 10 calls to a given number with a one week period.

 1. Create a Verified Caller ID Object using the appropriate REST endpoint.
 2. The SignalWire platform will place a call to the phone number that you specified.
   * You may request a redial by submitting a request to the Redial Verification Call Endpoint.
 3. When the phone is answered, we will read a six-digit code.
 4. To verify that you are the owner, take that number and submit it to the Validate Verifications Endpoint.
   * You have 5 attempts to enter the code correctly.
