Multi-factor authentication, commonly known as MFA, adds security to your application by requesting a user to be verified via voice or via text message.

It can also be used for One Time Password flows (OTP).

SignalWire will place a voice call or send a message to the destination you specify, and create an unique code for them. When your application receives input from the user, it will use the verification endpoint to check that the ID for the request and the token match. The API keeps track of attempts.
