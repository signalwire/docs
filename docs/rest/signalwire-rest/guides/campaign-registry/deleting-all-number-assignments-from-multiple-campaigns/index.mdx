# Delete all number assignments from multiple campaigns

## Overview

This snippet will show how you can easily use our [Delete Phone Number Assignments Endpoint](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/delete-number-assignment) to remove all of the phone number assignments from multiple campaigns. This frees up the numbers to be used in any other campaigns or for use cases other than 10DLC messaging. You only need a CSV with multiple campaign SIDs to get started!

:::info This script will only remove number assignments from a campaign - it will not remove from the account!

If you need to [remove numbers entirely](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/release-phone-number) from your SignalWire Space, check out our guide on _**[Releasing Numbers](/platform/phone-numbers/guides/releasing-dids)**_.

:::

What do I need to run this code?
--------------------------------

The API requires that you authenticate yourself using your Project ID, API Token, and Space URL. If you do not know where to find these values, check out our guide [here](/platform/dashboard/get-started/explore#api)!

You will also need a CSV containing campaign SIDs in the first column. You can name the column headers anything you want but if the SID is not in the first column, you will need to adjust the code. 

```text
CampaignSID,CampaignID
60a12b34-6aaa-4aaa-baaa-7aaaaaaaaaaa,C123XXX
60a12b34-6aaa-4aaa-baaa-7aaaaaaaaaaa,C234XXX
```

Your campaign SIDs can be found in your portal under **Messaging Campaigns** -> **Campaigns** or by [listing campaigns using our endpoint](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/list-campaigns).
It is the UUID listed under your Campaign Name.

Step by Step Code Walkthrough
-----------------------------

The first step is always to import our required libraries/packages and assign the necessary authentication variables to be used later. We will be using `requests` and `requests.auth` to handle our HTTP requests with ease as well as `csv`! We will also create an empty list to store the campaign SIDs that we get from our csv file.

```python
import requests
import csv
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# assign client variables
SpaceURL = 'EXAMPLE.signalwire.com'
projectID = ""
authToken = ""
host = f"https://{SpaceURL}"
campaigns = []
```

Next, we will use `csv` to read in our CSV file of campaign SIDs and add them to our `campaigns` list. 

```python
# read in campaigns CSV
with open("Campaigns.csv", 'r', encoding='utf-8-sig') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    next(reader, None)
    for row in reader:
        campaigns.append(row[0])
```

In the next section, we will loop through the campaign SIDs in `campaigns` one at a time. For each campaign, we will list **all** of the numbers assigned to the campaign using the List Number Assignments endpoint and store the JSON data returned from the API in `campaignNumbers`. 


:::danger Completed vs Pending numbers

Listing all numbers will return both completed and pending number assignments, but number assignments cannot be deleted by API unless they are completed. If you need pending number assignments deleted, you can do this within your portal or reach out to SignalWire Support!

:::

```python
for campaign in campaigns:
    print(f"Starting campaign {campaign} now")

    # List All Campaign Numbers
    url = f"https://{SpaceURL}/api/relay/rest/registry/beta/campaigns/{campaign}/numbers"
    payload = {}
    headers = {}

    response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, data=payload, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(projectID, authToken)).json()
    campaignNumbers = response['data']

    while "next" in response['links'].keys():
        response = requests.get(host + response['links']['next'], auth=HTTPBasicAuth(projectID, authToken)).json()
        campaignNumbers.extend(response['data'])
```

We have now arrived at the final step! We will loop through the JSON data returned via the API and store the assignment SID, number SID, and the number itself in the variables `assignmentSID`, `numberSID`, and `tn`. We will then try to release the number using `assignmentSID` and either print that the number was successful or print the error code and the reason it was not successful. 

```python
# delete listed numbers
    for number in campaignNumbers:
        tn = number['phone_number']['number']
        numberSID = number['phone_number']['id']
        assignmentSID = number['id']

        try:
            url = f"https://{SpaceURL}/api/relay/rest/registry/beta/numbers/{assignmentSID}"
            payload = {}
            headers = {}
            response = requests.request("DELETE", url, headers=headers, data=payload,
                                        auth=HTTPBasicAuth(projectID, authToken))
            if response.ok:
                print(f"{tn} successfully deleted")
            else:
                print(f"{response.status_code} {response.text}. {tn} not deleted.")

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
```

Wrap up
-------

Keeping your brands/campaigns clean and up to date is very important to stay in compliance with all of the latest 10DLC requirements that The Campaign Registry has dictated. This script will let you remove all numbers from multiple campaigns quickly so that you don't have to go through them all one by one by hand.
