What are we going to do?
------------------------

This snippet incorporates SignalWire's [Campaign Registry API Endpoint](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/list-brands) to list all number assignments for your SignalWire Space.
You can then build a data frame with any information that you may need for better monitoring of your numbers.

The [List Phone Number Assignments Endpoint](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/list-number-assignments)
gives the capability of retrieving all assignments for the Brands and Campaigns created through your Space. 

In order to create a data table of phone number information, this application will begin by listing out all brands for your Space. 
Once all brands for your Space are listed, the code will dig through each of these brands to find the campaigns that are associated with them. 
Once all campaigns are listed, the next step is to search through all of these campaigns for their number assignments.

After all of the numbers have been listed, it is fairly simple to fill in the project ID, campaign ID, and the association status of each number listed. 
Then, the only thing left to do is combine it all into a data table and export it to a .csv file.

What you need to run the code
-----------------------------

For the following code to work, you will need to have pandas and requests installed. 

Read about the different ways to install pandas [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html).

Read about requests and how to install using pip [here](https://pypi.org/project/requests/).

What variables change?
----------------------

`projectID` - Your project ID is an alphanumeric string that tells the API endpoint where to find your project. 
You can find this in an easily copyable format by going to your SignalWire Portal and click the API tab on the left-hand side.  

`authToken` - Your Auth Token is an alphanumeric string that helps to authenticate your HTTP requests to SignalWire. 
You can create this (if you havenâ€™t already) or copy this in an easily copyable format by going to your SignalWire Portal and clicking the API tab. 
If you have not created an API token, press the blue new button. If you have, click show and copy the string. 

`SpaceURL` - Your Space URL is the domain of your Space, i.e. example.signalwire.com. 
This can also be found in an easily copyable format within the API tab in your SignalWire Space.

--------

```python

Comments
--------

This snippet introduced how to use the data given by the [SignalWire Campaign Registry API Endpoints](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/list-brands) to list out the phone numbers assigned to each campaign in your Space.
We learned how to list brands, list campaigns, and also list the number assignments. 
Lastly, through the usage of the _pandas package_, all of this data was formatted in a table and exported to CSV format.
