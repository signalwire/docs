# Overview

Welcome to SignalWire's REST API. Our REST API is a set of endpoints that make interacting with SignalWire, simple and familiar.

The REST API is structured like most other [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) APIs: we use predictable and clear resource-oriented URLs that utilize built-in HTTP features like authentication, verbs, and error codes. This enables you to easily use any HTTP client in any language to make requests.

Proper HTTP status codes and [JSON](http://www.json.org/) are returned in all REST API endpoints, including errors.
