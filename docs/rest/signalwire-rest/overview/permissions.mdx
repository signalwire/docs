### Default Permissions

By default, a token is created with the following permissions:

- `room.self.audio_mute`
- `room.self.audio_unmute`
- `room.self.video_mute`
- `room.self.video_unmute`
- `room.self.deaf`
- `room.self.undeaf`
- `room.self.set_input_volume`
- `room.self.set_output_volume`
- `room.self.set_input_sensitivity`
- `room.self.screenshare`
- `room.self.additional_source`

These default permissions allow the member to control their own audio and video settings without affecting the room settings or other members.
