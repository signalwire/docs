### Overview

Zoho CRM is a powerful Customer Relationship Manager that can be used to track leads, log customer calls, and more. With SignalWire SIP endpoints, and a Softphone we can use Zoho CRM to enable agents to make an outbound call to any Zoho CRM contact with the click of a button!

#### Goals

By the end of this guide we will have accomplished the following:

- Create a SIP endpoint
- Register a SignalWire SIP endpoint to our Softphone
- Create a Zoho CRM contact
- Click-to-Call our contact using our SignalWire-enabled Softphone

#### What Do I Need?

1. SignalWire account (guide [here](/platform/dashboard/getting-started/signing-up-for-a-space))
2. Purchased or Verified phone-number in your SignalWire Space (guide [here](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number))
3. Softphone client of your choosing. For this guide, we will use [MicroSIP](https://www.microsip.org/). More SoftPhones can be found ( [here](/platform/integrations/softphones/set-up-zoiper-softphone-with-signalwire) )
4. Zoho account with access to Zoho CRM. Register ( [here](https://www.zoho.com/sign/signup.html) )
5. Secondary phone number to test your calling feature. For this demo we will use a second SignalWire number, but feel free to use your personal number instead.

### SignalWire Setup

#### Purchase a Number

1. First, we will need to purchase a phone number with SignalWire.  
   This can be done by navigating to your SignalWire Dashboard, and clicking the `Phone Numbers` tab on the left-hand nav-bar.

2. Select `Get a Phone Number`, or the `+New` button.

3. Use SignalWire's filtering features to select a number that suits your needs, and click the `Buy` button.

4. Optionally, set a `Friendly Name` for the purchased number. This will make it easier to keep track of your numbers as you add more to your Space.

For more information on purchasing a phone number, check out our detailed guide ( [here](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number) )

#### Create a SIP endpoint

Now that we have our Phone Number, we can create our SIP endpoint. This endpoint will allow us to connect to a Softphone, and make outbound calls using our newly acquired number.

1. Navigate to your SignalWire Dashboard, and select `SIP` from the left-hand nav-bar.

2. Click the `Create a New Endpoint` button.

3. Select a Username and Password for your endpoint. These credentials are how you will connect your SIP endpoint to your Softphone.

4. Select the desired phone number you would like to set as your Caller ID. This can be any purchased or verified number in your SignalWire Space.

5. You may choose to set the outbound call policy to only allow this endpoint to dial other SIP endpoints. The default will allow calling to PSTN numbers as well.

6. Optionally, configure your codec and encryption settings. If you are not sure, it is suggested to leave them as their default settings.

For more information on creating a SIP endpoint, check out our detailed guide ( [here](/voice/sip/get-started) )

#### Connect SIP endpoint to SignalWire Phone Number

In the last step, we configured our SIP endpoint to call out using our Caller ID, but if a customer tried to call this number back, it would not reach the SIP endpoint.

To ensure returned calls reach our SIP endpoint:

1. Navigate to your SignalWire Dashboard, and select `Phone Numbers` from the left-hand nav-bar.

2. Select the Phone Number used, and click the `Edit` button.

3. In the `Accept Incoming Calls As` drop-down menu, ensure it is set to \`Voice Calls.

4. In the `Handle Calls Using` drop-down menu, select `SIP Endpoint`.

5. Use the drop-down/search feature to find the endpoint you created earlier. This will be the `Username` you set for your endpoint.

6. Finally, select the `Save` button to save your changes.

### Softphone Setup

Our Softphone set-up should be quite simple. For this example, we will be using MicroSIP.

#### Softphone choice

If you do not wish to use MicroSIP, SignalWire provides resources for several other popular Softphone options:

- [Zoiper](/platform/integrations/softphones/set-up-zoiper-softphone-with-signalwire)
- [Bria](/platform/integrations/softphones/set-up-bria-softphone-with-signalwire)
- [Linphone](/platform/integrations/softphones/connect-signalwire-with-linphone)
- [3CX Softphone](/platform/integrations/softphones/connect-signalwire-with-3cx)

#### Register Your Endpoint

1. Launch the MicroSIP client

2. Select `Add Account` from the top-right drop-down menu

3. `Account Name` is similar to the `Friendly Name` for our phone number, and is only to help keep track of several endpoints.

4. `SIP Server` and domain should be set to your SignalWire SIP domain.

5. `Username` should be the username of your SIP endpoint.

6. `Domain` should be the same as your `SIP Server`

7. `Login` and `Password` will be your endpoint `Username` and `Password`

8. Optionally, configure your encryption settings. If your endpoint requires encryption, set `Media Encryption` to `Mandatory SRTP`, and `Transport` to TLS.

:::caution Where is My SignalWire SIP Domain?

Your SIP domain can be found in the "SIP" page of your SignalWire Dashboard. Select the endpoint you would like to use, and copy the "Domain" portion of the Username/Domain as shown below.

### Zoho CRM Setup

All that is left is to import a contact into our Zoho CRM, and enable click-to-call in our settings.

#### Create a Contact

For the purposes of testing, you can create a contact with any fake information.

1. Navigate to Zoho CRM, and click `Contacts` in the top nav-bar.

2. Select `Create a Contact` and fill out the required information.

3. Set `Phone Number` to the phone number you would like to recieve a test call from.

4. Select `Save` and return to the contacts screen.

#### Click to Create a Call

1. Next to the `Phone Number` field should be a little phone icon, which will initiate the call.

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./82f7218-Clicktocall.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the Create a Call page. A red arrow labeled 'Click' points towards a small phone icon next to a phone number. In the right side of the image, a red arrow labeled 'Select your Softphone' points toward a menu allowing the user to choose between Google Phone and MicroSIP." />
</figure>

2. If this is your first time using this feature, you may have to select your Softphone as the default application for handling click-to-call.

3. If you have previously used click-to-call, you may have to change the default application to your desired Softphone. The way to do this will vary between Operating Systems.

:::tip You Made It!

If everything has been set up correctly, your Softphone software should launch, and initiate a call to the contact number set in Zoho CRM.

### Wrap Up

This guide is intended to be a step-by-step walkthrough for users of any skill/knowledge level. In summary we have:

1. Purchased a SignalWire Phone Number, and set it to accept calls as a SIP endpoint.

2. Created a SignalWire SIP endpoint and registered it to our MicroSIP Softphone

3. Created a contact in Zoho CRM and used the telephone link to call the client using our SignalWire-enabled Softphone.

### Try it Yourself
