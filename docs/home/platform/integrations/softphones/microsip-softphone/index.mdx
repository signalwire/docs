### Overview

In this guide, we will register a SIP endpoint to our MicroSIP Softphone. 
MicroSIP is an open-source, lightweight SIP client that works perfectly with SignalWire SIP endpoints.

### What Do I Need?

1. SignalWire account (guide [here](/platform/dashboard/getting-started/signing-up-for-a-space))

2. Purchased or Verified phone-number in your SignalWire Space.
Read our guide to [Buying a Phone Number](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number)
for more information.

3. Softphone client of your choosing. For this guide, we will use [MicroSIP](https://www.microsip.org/).

### SignalWire Setup

To get started making calls, we will need to purchase a phone number and create a SignalWire SIP endpoint.

#### Purchase a Number

1. First, we will need to purchase a phone number with SignalWire.  
   This can be done by navigating to your SignalWire Dashboard, and clicking the `Phone Numbers` tab on the left-hand nav-bar.

2. Select `Get a Phone Number`, or the `+New` button.

3. Use SignalWire's filtering features to select a number that suits your needs, and click the `Buy` button.

4. Optionally, set a `Friendly Name` for the purchased number. This will make it easier to keep track of your numbers as you add more to your Space.

For more information on purchasing a phone number, check out our detailed guide to [Buying a Phone Number](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number).

#### Create a SIP endpoint

Now that we have our Phone Number, we can create our SIP endpoint. 
This endpoint will allow us to connect to a Softphone, and make outbound calls using our newly acquired number.

1. Navigate to your SignalWire Dashboard, and select `SIP` from the left-hand nav-bar.

2. Click the `Create a New Endpoint` button.

3. Select a Username and Password for your endpoint. 
These credentials are how you will connect your SIP endpoint to your Softphone.

4. Select the desired phone number you would like to set as your Caller ID. 
This can be any purchased or verified number in your SignalWire Space.

5. Optionally, configure your codec and encryption settings. 
If you are not sure, it is suggested to leave them as their default settings.

For more information on creating a SIP endpoint, check out our detailed guide to 
[setting up a SIP endpoint](/voice/sip/get-started).

#### Connect SIP endpoint to SignalWire Phone Number

In the last step, we configured our SIP endpoint to call out using our Caller ID, but if a customer tried to call this number back, it would not reach the SIP endpoint. 

To ensure returned calls reach our SIP endpoint:

1. Navigate to your SignalWire Dashboard, and select `Phone Numbers` from the left-hand nav-bar.

2. Select the Phone Number used, and click the `Edit` button.

3. In the `Accept Incoming Calls As` drop-down menu, ensure it is set to \`Voice Calls.

4. In the `Handle Calls Using` drop-down menu, select `SIP Endpoint`.

5. Use the drop-down/search feature to find the enpoint you created earlier. 
   This will be the `Username` you set for your endpoint.

6. Finally, select the `Save` button to save your changes.

### MicroSIP Setup

#### Download and Install

1. Navigate to [here](https://www.microsip.org/downloads) and install MicroSIP or MicroSIP Lite depending on the features you need. 
If you just plan on using this for Voice calls, either client will work!

#### Register Your Endpoint

1. Launch the MicroSIP client

2. Select `Add Account` from the top-right drop-down menu

3. `Account Name` is similar to the `Friendly Name` for our phone number, and is only to help keep track of several endpoints.

4. `SIP Server` and domain should be set to your SignalWire SIP domain.

Where is my SignalWire SIP Domain?

</figure>

5. `Username` should be the username of your SIP endpoint.

6. `Domain` should be the same as your `SIP Server`

7. `Login` and `Password` will be your endpoint `Username` and `Password`

 Security-Minded?

8. Optionally, configure your encryption settings. If your endpoint requires encryption, set `Media Encryption` to `Mandatory SRTP`, and `Transport` to TLS.

With this set, you can return to your SignalWire Dashboard, and set `Encryption` to `Required`.

:::tip Finished!

You should now be able to handle inbound and outbound calling from your SIP endpoint using MicroSIP.
