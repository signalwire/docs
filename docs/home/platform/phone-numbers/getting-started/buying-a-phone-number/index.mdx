## Types of Phone Number

To purchase a new number, click the blue **New** button in the upper right hand corner. 
Three types of numbers are available for purchase: 

- **Local long code numbers:** Conventional 10-digit phone numbers with local area codes.
  - For example: `(214) XXX-XXXX`, `(682) XXX-XXXX`, `(817) XXX-XXXX`, and so on.
- **Toll-free numbers:** 800 numbers.
- **Shortcode numbers:** 5 or 6 digit numbers used for enterprise messaging.

Local and toll-free numbers can be purchased and deployed virtually instantly.
Select the type of number you'd like to purchase, and we can now move on to other distinguishing search factors.

Shortcodes require an application process.

## Advanced Search

If you're okay with any number, you can simply select **Buy** on the first one that catches your eye. 
However, in most cases, there are specific area codes or regions that you are looking for.

The search filter tools allow you to narrow down your search by including area code, region, or region & city. 
You can also tell the search to return all numbers that contain, start with, or end with a certain sequence of numbers, or even a word.

Once you find the number you want, simply select **Buy**.
