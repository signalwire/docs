# Managing Your SignalWire Resources

## **Resources Overview** {#resources}
Resources are the primary entities for communication within the Call Fabric ecosystem.
They are the building blocks of the system, representing the various communication elements
that can be used to interact with [subscribers](#subscribers). 
The different types of Resources can be found in the [Resource Types](#resource-types) section.

---

### Creating Resources {#creating-resources}

To create a Resource in your SignalWire Space, you will need to click on the `Resources` tab in the left-hand navigation menu.
From there, you can select the type of Resource you would like to create by clicking on the `+ Add` button.

After selecting the type of Resource you would like to create, you will be prompted to enter the details for the Resource on a new page. 
Upon completion, you can click on the `Create` button to create the Resource.

### Editing Resources

To modify a Resource within your SignalWire Space, navigate to the `Resources` page and select the desired Resource.
This action directs you to the details page of that Resource. 
Here, by selecting the `Edit` button, you can alter the specifics of the Resource.

### Deleting Resources

From your Resources page, you can delete a Resource by clicking on the trashcan icon next to the Resource you would like to delete.
This will prompt you to confirm the deletion of the Resource.
Once you have confirmed the deletion, the Resource will be removed from your SignalWire Space.
