# Subscribers Overview

<Subtitle>The foundation of user management in Call Fabric</Subtitle>

## What are Subscribers?

Subscribers are one of the most fundamental and valuable [Resources][resources] in SignalWire's Call Fabric platform. While you can think of a Subscriber as a "user," the concept is actually broader, encompassing comprehensive features and services for onboarding, management, and utilization of Call Fabric services.

Subscribers embody SignalWire's approach to **Programmable Unified Communications (PUC)**, enabling developers to quickly and securely onboard and manage large numbers of users while saving months of development and testing time.
