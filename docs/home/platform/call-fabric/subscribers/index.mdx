# Subscribers overview

<Subtitle>The foundation of user management in Call Fabric</Subtitle>

## What are subscribers?

Subscribers are the core [Resources][resources] in SignalWire's Call Fabric platform that represent users 
in your communication system. More than just a simple user account, Subscribers provide a complete user 
management solution with built-in authentication, communication endpoints, and billing integration.

Subscribers represent users in your communication system with enterprise-grade capabilities built-in.
They embody SignalWire's approach to **Programmable Unified Communications (PUC)**, enabling you to onboard 
and manage users at scale without building complex infrastructure from scratch.

## What's included

Every Subscriber comes with four core components that work together to provide a complete user management solution:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Identity & authentication" icon={<MdSecurity />} color="blue">
    **Secure User Management**
    
    Industry-standard credential storage with usernames and passwords. Extensible profile system for names, 
    emails, company details, timezones, and locations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Communication endpoints" icon={<MdPhoneInTalk />} color="green">
    **Multi-Channel Connectivity**
    
    Private Call Fabric address for internal communication plus public phone numbers for external calls. 
    Full SIP, WebRTC, and PSTN support.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Settings & configuration" icon={<MdSettings />} color="purple">
    **Flexible Configuration**
    
    Customizable codec settings, encryption options, and SIP/WebRTC protocols. Configurable communication 
    preferences and routing rules.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>


## How it works

Subscribers are built on three core technical systems:

### Resource addressing

Subscribers use Call Fabric's unified addressing system for consistent identification across all platform 
[Resources][resources]. Each Subscriber is uniquely identified by an address in the format `/<Context>/<Name>`.

**Addresses make Subscribers directly callable.** When a call is placed to a Subscriber's address, Call Fabric 
automatically routes the call directly to that Subscriber. This enables seamless peer-to-peer communication 
without complex routing configuration.

**Common Address Examples:**
```
/private/john-doe           # Direct dial to John's devices
/public/support-agent       # Publicly accessible support line
/private/jane?channel=video # Video call to Jane
```

**How Direct Calling Works:**
- When someone calls `/private/john-doe`, the call rings John's registered device
- The Subscriber can answer on any device (mobile app, web browser, desk phone)
- Call Fabric handles device registration, presence, and simultaneous ring automatically

Subscribers default to `private` context for security, with optional public aliases for external access.

### Authentication system

Multiple token types provide flexible security and integration options:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card 
    title={
      <>
        <APIBadge method="POST" />
        Subscriber Tokens
      </>
    }
    color="blue"
  >
    **Standard user authentication**
    
    For End Users: Issued during login, provide access to user-specific resources. Perfect for web and mobile app authentication flows.

  </Card>
  
  <Card 
    title={
      <>
        <APIBadge method="POST" />
        Guest Tokens
      </>
    }
    color="green"
  >
    **Temporary guest access**
    
    For Guest Users: Allows Subscribers to create guest tokens that provide temporary access to specific Resource addresses. The guest token creates a temporary subscriber with limited permissions to access only the specified `allowed_address`.
    
    [View API Documentation →][guest-tokens]
  </Card>
  
  <Card 
    title={
      <>
        <APIBadge method="POST" />
        Invite Tokens
      </>
    }
    color="purple"
  >
    **Client-side API access**
    
    For Client Applications: Creates a Subscriber Invite Token that enables client-side bearer token authentication for API calls.
    
    [View API Documentation →][invite-tokens]
  </Card>
  
  <Card 
    title={
      <>
        <APIBadge method="POST" />
        Refresh Tokens
      </>
    }
    color="orange"
  >
    **Session management**
    
    For Seamless Experience: Handle automatic token renewal and session management without frequent re-authentication.

      </>
    }
    color="green"
  >
    **Create new Subscribers**

      <>
        <APIBadge method="DELETE" />
        Remove Subscriber
      </>
    }
    color="red"
  >
    **Delete Subscribers**
    
    Remove Subscribers and associated data with proper cleanup and notifications.
    
    [View API Documentation →][delete-subscriber]
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Bulk operations handle large user populations efficiently, while webhooks provide real-time notifications for lifecycle events,
authentication, and communication activities.

## Integration example

Here's how Subscribers work in practice with the [Browser SDK][browser-sdk]:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="auth" label="Authentication" default>
    ```javascript
    import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/js";

    // Initialize the client with your token
    const client = await SignalWire({
      token: "<TOKEN>"  // Replace with your actual token
    });

    // Client is now ready to make and receive calls
    console.log("SignalWire client initialized");
    ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="outbound" label="Making calls">
    ```javascript
    import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/js";

    // Initialize the client
    const client = await SignalWire({
      token: "<TOKEN>"
    });

    // Make a call to another subscriber
    const call = await client.dial({
      to: "/private/jane-doe",
      rootElement: document.getElementById("videoContainer")
    });

    // Handle call events
    call.on("call.state", (state) => {
      console.log("Call state:", state);
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="inbound" label="Receiving calls">
    ```javascript
    import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/js";

    // Define the incoming call handler
    const handleIncomingCall = async (notification) => {
      const { invite } = notification;
      console.log("Incoming call from:", invite.from);
      
      // Accept the call
      const call = await invite.accept({
        rootElement: document.getElementById("videoContainer")
      });
    };

    // Initialize the client with the handler
    const client = await SignalWire({
      token: "<TOKEN>",
      incomingCallHandlers: {
        all: handleIncomingCall
      }
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Common use patterns

- **Peer-to-Peer Calling**: Direct subscriber-to-subscriber calls using private addresses like `/private/john-doe`
- **Conference Rooms**: Multiple subscribers joining shared resources like `/public/team-meeting`
- **AI Agent Interaction**: Subscribers calling AI agents at addresses like `/public/support-ai`
- **PSTN & SIP Calling**: Ability to call PSTN and SIP destinations directly from Subscriber applications

## Common use cases

These technical patterns enable real-world applications across industries:

## Getting started

Ready to implement Subscribers? Follow these steps:

<Steps>

### Create your first subscriber

Navigate to the [SignalWire Dashboard][create-subscribers] and create your first Subscriber through the Resources section. This establishes your user entity and generates authentication credentials.

### Configure user profile

Set up credentials, contact information, and Resource addresses. Configure timezone, location, and other 
profile details for cross-channel communication.

### Set security context

Configure private and public contexts based on your security needs. Determine which Subscribers need 
public aliases and establish access controls.

### Implementation

Use the [Browser SDK][browser-sdk] or [REST API][rest-api] to connect your application with Subscriber authentication. Implement token management and session handling.

</Steps>
