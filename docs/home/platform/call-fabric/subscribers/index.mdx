# Subscribers Overview

<Subtitle>The foundation of user management in Call Fabric</Subtitle>

## What are Subscribers?

Subscribers are the core [Resources][resources] in SignalWire's Call Fabric platform that represent users 
in your communication system. More than just a simple user account, Subscribers provide a complete user 
management solution with built-in authentication, communication endpoints, and billing integration.

Subscribers represent users in your communication system with enterprise-grade capabilities built-in.
They embody SignalWire's approach to **Programmable Unified Communications (PUC)**, enabling you to onboard 
and manage users at scale without building complex infrastructure from scratch.

## What's Included

Every Subscriber comes with four core components that work together to provide a complete user management solution:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>


## How It Works

Subscribers are built on three core technical systems:

### Resource Addressing

Subscribers use Call Fabric's unified addressing system for consistent identification across all platform 
[Resources][resources]. Each Subscriber is uniquely identified by an address in the format `/<Context>/<Name>`.

**Addresses make Subscribers directly callable.** When a call is placed to a Subscriber's address, Call Fabric 
automatically routes the call directly to that Subscriber. This enables seamless peer-to-peer communication 
without complex routing configuration.

**Common Address Examples:**
```
/private/john-doe           # Direct dial to John's devices
/public/support-agent       # Publicly accessible support line
/private/jane?channel=video # Video call to Jane
```

**How Direct Calling Works:**
- When someone calls `/private/john-doe`, the call rings John's registered device
- The Subscriber can answer on any device (mobile app, web browser, desk phone)
- Call Fabric handles device registration, presence, and simultaneous ring automatically

Subscribers default to `private` context for security, with optional public aliases for external access.

### Authentication System

Multiple token types provide flexible security and integration options:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card 
    title={
      <>
        <APIBadge method="POST" />
        Subscriber Tokens
      </>
    }
    color="blue"
  >
    **Standard user authentication**
    
    For End Users: Issued during login, provide access to user-specific resources. Perfect for web and mobile app authentication flows.

  </Card>
  
  <Card 
    title={
      <>
        <APIBadge method="POST" />
        Guest Tokens
      </>
    }
    color="green"
  >
    **Temporary guest access**
    
    For Guest Users: Allows Subscribers to create guest tokens that provide temporary access to specific Resource addresses. The guest token creates a temporary subscriber with limited permissions to access only the specified `allowed_address`.
    
    [View API Documentation →][guest-tokens]
  </Card>
  
  <Card 
    title={
      <>
        <APIBadge method="POST" />
        Invite Tokens
      </>
    }
    color="purple"
  >
    **Client-side API access**
    
    For Client Applications: Creates a Subscriber Invite Token that enables client-side bearer token authentication for API calls.

  </Card>
  
  <Card 
    title={
      <>
        <APIBadge method="POST" />
        Refresh Tokens
      </>
    }
    color="orange"
  >
    **Session management**
    
    For Seamless Experience: Handle automatic token renewal and session management without frequent re-authentication.

  <Card 
    title={
      <>
        <APIBadge method="DELETE" />
        Remove Subscriber
      </>
    }
    color="red"
  >
    **Delete Subscribers**
    
    Remove Subscribers and associated data with proper cleanup and notifications.
    
    [View API Documentation →][delete-subscriber]
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Bulk operations handle large user populations efficiently, while webhooks provide real-time notifications for lifecycle events,
authentication, and communication activities.

## Integration Example

Here's how Subscribers work in practice with the [Browser SDK][browser-sdk]:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="auth" label="Authentication" default>
    ```javascript
    import { SignalWire } from "@signalwire/js";

    async function main() {
      const client = await SignalWire({
        token: "<TOKEN>",
      });
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="outbound" label="Making Calls">
    ```javascript
    // Dial another subscriber
    const call = await client.dial({
      to: "/private/jane-doe",
      rootElement: document.getElementById("videoContainer")
    });

    // Dial a public resource (e.g., support queue)
    const supportCall = await client.dial({
      to: "/public/support-queue",
      rootElement: document.getElementById("videoContainer"),
      audio: true,
      video: false  // Audio-only call
    });

    // Dial with custom media constraints
    const videoCall = await client.dial({
      to: "/private/john-smith",
      rootElement: document.getElementById("videoContainer"),
      audio: true,
      video: {
        width: { ideal: 1280 },
        height: { ideal: 720 }
      }
    });

    // Handle call events
    call.on("call.ended", () => {
      console.log("Call ended");
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="inbound" label="Receiving Calls">
    ```javascript
    // Configure handlers for incoming calls
    const incomingCallHandlers = {
      all: async (notification) => {
        // The invite object contains call details
        const { invite } = notification;
        console.log("Incoming call from:", invite.from);
        
        // Accept the call
        const call = await invite.accept({
          rootElement: document.getElementById("videoContainer")
        });
        
        // Or reject the call
        // await invite.reject();
      }
    };
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Common Use Patterns

- **Peer-to-Peer Calling**: Direct subscriber-to-subscriber calls using private addresses like `/private/john-doe`
- **Conference Rooms**: Multiple subscribers joining shared resources like `/public/team-meeting`
- **AI Agent Interaction**: Subscribers calling AI agents at addresses like `/public/support-ai`
- **PSTN & SIP Calling**: Ability to call PSTN and SIP destinations directly from Subscriber applications

## Common Use Cases

These technical patterns enable real-world applications across industries:

## Management & Monitoring

Once your Subscribers are deployed in production, you'll need visibility and control:

### Dashboard Management

Create and manage Subscribers through the SignalWire Dashboard with bulk operations and real-time monitoring.

### Activity Tracking

Monitor activity with detailed event logs, CSV export capabilities, and Resource ID tracking for debugging and analytics.

## Getting Started

Ready to implement Subscribers? Follow these steps:

<Steps>

### Create Your First Subscriber

Navigate to the [SignalWire Dashboard][create-subscribers] and create your first Subscriber through the 
Resources section. This establishes your user entity and generates authentication credentials.

### Configure User Profile

Set up credentials, contact information, and Resource addresses. Configure timezone, location, and other 
profile details for cross-channel communication.

### Set Security Context

Configure private and public contexts based on your security needs. Determine which Subscribers need 
public aliases and establish access controls.

### Implementation

Use the [Browser SDK][browser-sdk] or [REST API][rest-api] to connect your application with Subscriber authentication. Implement 
token management and session handling.

</Steps>
