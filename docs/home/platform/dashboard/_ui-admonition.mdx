:::info Does your sidebar look different?

Depending on the version of your SignalWire Space you are using, you may see two different UIs. 

<Accordion 
  title="Learn about the Legacy UI migration"
  defaultOpen={false}
  onChange={(isOpen) => console.log('Accordion state:', isOpen)}
>

Please use the tabs below to identify which UI you are using. The instructions below will be different depending on which UI you are using.

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="newui" label="New Dashboard">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col col--4">
