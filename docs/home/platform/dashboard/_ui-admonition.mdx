Depending on the version of your SignalWire Space you are using, you may see two different UIs. 

The resources that were accessible in the sidebar of the legacy UI are now located in the unified Resource menu.

Please use the tabs below to identify which UI you are using. The instructions below will be different depending on which UI you are using.
