:::info Does your sidebar look different?

If your account was created **prior to 2025**, your Dashboard may be on the Legacy UI.

<Accordion 
  title="Learn about the Legacy UI migration"
  defaultOpen={false}
  onChange={(isOpen) => console.log('Accordion state:', isOpen)}
>

Identify your Dashboard and select between Legacy and New UIs using the tabs below.
