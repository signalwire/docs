# Exporting Logs from your SignalWire Space

SignalWire provides a way to download logs in **CSV** format from your SignalWire Space. This is useful for when you are troubleshooting an issue,
looking at the volume of your traffic, investigate billing, or just want to see what's going on in your Space.

## Navigating to your logs

To get to your logs, you will need to navigate to the **Logs** tab in the left-hand navigation bar in your SignalWire Space.

## Exporting Logs

Once you are in the logs tab, you will see a list of all the logs that have been generated in your Space.
They will be seperated into different categories, such as **Voice (Calling) Logs**, **Video (Conferencing) Logs**
, **Messaging Logs**, and **Fax Logs**.

Additionally, you can filter the logs by **Date Ranges** or **Specific Dates** by clicking the filter icon in the top right corner.

Once you have found the logs you are looking for, you can export them by clicking the **Export CSV**
button on the right-hand side.

Once you have clicked the **Export CSV** button, you will be prompted to Accept the Export. Click **OK** to continue.

This will then pop up a notification that will inform you that your log export request has been submitted, and will be
processed shortly. Once the export is complete, you will receive an email with a link to download the logs.
