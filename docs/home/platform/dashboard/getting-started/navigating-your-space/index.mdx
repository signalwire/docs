# Navigating your SignalWire Space

Congratulations, now you have a SignalWire Space!
If not, [create one here](https://signalwire.com/signups/new).
You can then _log in_ at [here](https://signalwire.com/signin). 
Here's a quick walkthrough to make sure you can find everything you need.

## Toolbar

In the upper-right corner, you'll notice your toolbar has several items of importance.

By clicking the bell, you can see our updates of new API features, updates to current APIs, upcoming LiveWire sessions to demonstrate SignalWire capabilities with real time Q&A, and more. 
To the right of that, a help menu provides you with helpful links for further information and support. 
Farther right, your current SignalWire balance is displayed next to a link to add credit to that balance. 
Finally, the account icon with the drop-down menu on the far right will allow you to view your profile or log out.

    alt="A screenshot of the top toolbar in your SignalWire Space. There is a notification icon, a link to 'Help and Support', a balance of $95.09, a button to 'Add Credit', and a profile icon."
  />

</figure>

When you click on the dropdown menu to the view your profile, you will see additional options including **"Profile, Billing, Users, and Settings"** as well as the option to switch SignalWire Spaces or log out.

:::info Admin pages

You will not be able to view Billing, Users, or Settings unless you are an Admin on that SignalWire Space.
