# Create a SignalWire Space

To use our services and products, you need a new SignalWire account. 
From the [website home page](https://signalwire.com/), click on Sign Up in the top right.

## Signing up with a social account

You have two options for sign up. 
First, you can choose to sign up with one of our supported authorization providers: GitHub, Google, or LinkedIn.

    alt="Sign up Selector showing Github, Google, LinkedIn, and email logos."
  />
</figure>

1. Click on the provider icon of your choice.
2. Choose the account to connect.
3. Name your Space. 
   This is your personal SignalWire domain to which all services are tied. 
   We recommend using your company name.

    className="img-600"
    src={require("./Space-Setup.webP").default}
    alt="Space Setup page with fields labeled Company Name, Space URL, Your Role, and What are you most interested in building?"
  />
</figure>

4. Next, verify a phone number. Adding a phone number as a verified caller ID will allow you to send
   outgoing calls using this number as the caller ID.
5. Finally, answer our short onboarding survey so we can point you toward the right resources for your needs.

## Signing up with email

If you prefer to sign up with an email address, the sign-up flow is slightly different.

    className="img-600"
    src={require("./Sign-Up-Selector-Email.webP").default}
    alt="Sign up Selector page with email text field circled in red."
  />
</figure>

1. Enter your email address.
2. You will first receive an email with a confirmation code.
3. Entering the code will allow you to set sign-in credentials. This name will also be the username associated with your Space.

     <img
       className="img-600"
       src={require("./Email-Verification-and-Login.webP").default}
       alt="Email verification screen and Login Credentials Setu."
     />
   </figure>
4. Name your Space. This is your personal SignalWire domain to which all services are tied.
   <figure>
     <img
       className="img-600"
       src={require("./Space-Setup.webP").default}
       alt="Space Setup page with fields labeled Company Name, Space URL, Your Role, and What are you most interested in building?"
     />
   </figure>
5. Next, you will verify a phone number. Adding a phone number as a verified caller ID will allow you to send outgoing calls using this number as the caller ID.
6. Finally, answer our short onboarding survey so we can point you toward the right resources for your needs.

## Next steps

Please note that no matter which method you choose for sign-up, your account will start in Trial Mode, which has some limitations put in place. 
Read about those limitations in the [trial mode guide](/platform/dashboard/guides/trial-mode), or top up your account manually with $5.00 in order to exit. 
Note that accounts in Trial Mode receive a $5.00 credit to test SignalWire services. 
If you are an existing user, you will not recieve this credit if you create a new Space. 
This $5.00 credit also does not apply to the $5.00 minimum to exit Trial Mode.

Once you are signed up, you will find yourself on the Dashboard, the command center of your SignalWire account.

Your next step will be setting up a Project. 
They are used to group resources according to your preference, such as by customer account, by geographical region, or any other classification. 
Name your project something that will help to distinguish it from the other projects you will make in the future, and you're ready to go.
