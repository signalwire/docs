# Create an account

<Frame>
![Sign up for a SignalWire account.](@image/dashboard/signup.webp)
</Frame>

<Steps>

### Sign up

Initiate the process by entering an email address or selecting a supported authorization provider.

<Card 
    title="Sign up for a SignalWire account" 
    icon={<FaIdBadge />}
    href="https://signalwire.com/signup"
  >
    Open a new account and reserve a  unique `.signalwire.com` Space domain.
  </Card>

### Name your SignalWire Space

This is your unique `.signalwire.com` domain to which all services are tied. 
We recommend using your company name.

Keep the following in mind:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Choose wisely" icon={<IoIosSave/>}>Once set, your Space domain cannot be changed except by a Support request.</Card>
  <Card title="Multiple spaces" icon={<MdWorkspacesFilled/>}>You can create multiple Spaces associated with your SignalWire account.</Card>
  <Card title="Accounts, Spaces, Projects" icon={<MdLineStyle/>}>Each Space can contain multiple Projects.</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Create a Project

Projects are used to group resources according to your preference, such as by customer account, by geographical region, or any other classification. 
Name your project something that will help to distinguish it from the other projects you will make in the future, and you're ready to go.

Now you have a SignalWire Space and your first project. Congratulations!
