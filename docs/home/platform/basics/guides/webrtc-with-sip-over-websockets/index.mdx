SignalWire supports industry-standard WebRTC SIP over WebSockets! This means that you can use off-the-shelf JavaScript libraries with SIP to connect to SignalWire services.

Services enabled in a WebRTC compliant browser include:

- Audio calling to/from Web and PSTN
- product:video calling between Web and SIP endpoints
- Programmatically creating SIP endpoints and directing calls to your WebRTC endpoints

To get started, navigate to your SignalWire Space and create a new SIP endpoint. To use secure protocols, make sure the Encryption is **required**.

Now, you can test the newly created endpoint on a popular JS SIP (JSSIP) library:

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./4e31aa1-rtaImage.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the TryIt JS SIP interface. In the 'Your Name' input field, the user has entered 'jssip1'. There is a gear icon and a button labeled 'Reset'." />
</figure>

If you click the **gear** icon, you can configure the settings needed to connect to SignalWire. The **SIP URI** is your SignalWire SIP username and domain. The password set on your SIP endpoint can be used in the **SIP password** section to authenticate. The **WebSocket URI** is your domain with an appended **wss://**. To match the encryption on SignalWire, set the transport to TLS. The Registrar Server should be set to your domain.

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./8b50f21-rtaImage_1.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the JsSIP UA settings pane, with fields for SIP URI, SIP Password, WebSocket URI, Via Transport, and Registrar Server." />
</figure>

Once you've saved the entered information, you will see the endpoint register and turn from yellow to green as it appears below:

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./395d2a6-rtaImage_2.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the TryIt JsSIP interface showing a registered endpoint with a green dot." />
</figure>

Then, set up another SIP endpoint with the same process as above:

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./9950746-rtaImage_3.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the TryIt JsSIP interface showing a second registered endpoint." />
</figure>

Now that both of the endpoints are registered, you can place the first call. If you're using SIP endpoints in the same project, you can use short-hand names (for example, jssip1 and jssip2 as seen in the images above) to place the call:

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./ef452c9-rtaImage_4.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the TryIt JsSIP interface showing a green dot next to the jssip2 endpoint. In the field labeled 'SIP URI or username', the endpoint named jssip1 has been entered. A blue button is labeled 'Call'." />
</figure>

If everything was set up correctly, you should see something similar to this:

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./0ceae3c-rtaImage_5.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the TryIt JsSIP interface showing a working video call." />
</figure>

In addition, you can attribute a phone number to your created sip endpoint and receive calls from the PSTN! You can also place the outbound calls to the PSTN from the WebRTC client. 

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./684523f-rtaImage_6.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the JsSIP interface showing an incoming call. The call is from a PSTN phone number associated with a SIP endpoint, so both are shown. Buttons underneath allow the user to Answer or Reject the call." />
</figure>
