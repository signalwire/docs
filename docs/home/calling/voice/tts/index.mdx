# Voices and languages

SignalWire's cloud platform integrates with leading third-party text-to-speech (TTS) providers.
This guide describes supported engines, voices, and languages.
Refer to each provider's documentation for up-to-date model details and service information.

## **Compare providers and models**

SignalWire's TTS providers offer a wide range of voice engines optimized for various applications.
Select a provider, model, and voice according to the following considerations:

**Cost:** 
When cost-efficiency is the top priority, select a Standard-tier voice from 
[Google Cloud](#google-cloud) or [Amazon Polly](#amazon-polly). 
Review our [pricing information](#pricing) to learn more.

**Language support:** 
[Amazon Polly](#amazon-polly), [ElevenLabs](#elevenlabs), [Google Cloud](#google-cloud), and [OpenAI](#openai) 
offer a wide range of supported languages.
In addition, all [ElevenLabs](#elevenlabs) and [OpenAI](#openai) voices are fully multilingual.

**Model quality and realism:** All four supported providers offer high-quality engines: 
[Google Cloud](#google-cloud)'s WaveNet and Neural2, 
[Amazon Polly](#amazon-polly) Neural,
 ElevenLabs' [Multilingual v2](#elevenlabs), 
and Deepgram's [Aura](#deepgram)
are all optimized for voice quality.

**SSML support:** Google Cloud and Amazon Polly support 
[SSML](/docs/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/say.mdx#speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml) 
(Speech Synthesis Markup Language) as a string wrapped in `<speak>` tags. 
Consult [Google Cloud's SSML docs](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml) for details.
Refer to the Amazon Polly docs for more information on 
[using SSML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/ssml.html)
and [supported SSML tags.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supportedtags.html)

## **Use voice identifier strings**

Compose voice identifier strings using the `<engine>.<voice id>` format.

First, select your engine using the `gcloud`, `polly`, `elevenlabs`, or `deepgram` identifier. 
Append a period (`.`), followed by the specific **voice ID** from the TTS provider.

:::tip Case insensitivity

Voice identifier strings are **case insensitive**.
For example,
`gcloud.en-US-Neural2-A`,
`gcloud.en-us-neural2-a`, and
`GCLOUD.EN-US-NEURAL2-A` are equivalent.
:::

For detailed instructions for each provider, consult the voice ID references linked in the **Usage** column of the below table.
