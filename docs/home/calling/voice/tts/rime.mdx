## Build with Rime on SignalWire

<Steps>

### Create an account and add credit

If you don't have one yet, you'll need a SignalWire account.
Create one, and then be sure to add some credit to test with.

### Add a new Resource

<AddResource/>

### Create a SWML Script

Name it something fun and recognizable.
Ours is titled Rime Wizard.

Next, paste the following starter script into the text box, and hit <kbd>Save</kbd>:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - play: 
      - "ring:5:uk" # this is just for instant feedback if something is breaking the script

# Rime Mist v2

  - play:
      url: "say:Hey, you're speaking to Abbie from Rime's Mist v2 text-to-speech model. Nice to meet you!"
      say_voice: "rime.abbie"
```

### Buy and assign a phone number

Navigate to the **Phone Numbers** section of the Dashboard.

Purchase a phone number and assign it to the desired SWML script.

### Give it a call!

Call the assigned number
