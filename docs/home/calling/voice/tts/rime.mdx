## Models

Rime offers three primary models:

### Mist

Rime's first model

### Mist v2



### Arcana

Ready to make magic happen?

Arcana is Rime's latest and greatest model, offering ultra-realistic speech-to-text in a variety of voices.
These voices prioritize authenticity and character, capturing natural rhythms and tiny imperfections that make voices sound human.
Perfect for creative applications where realism is a top priority.
