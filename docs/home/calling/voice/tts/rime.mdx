## Build with Rime on SignalWire

<Steps>

### Create a Space and add credit

If you don't have one yet, you'll need to 
[create a SignalWire Space](/platform/dashboard/getting-started/signing-up-for-a-space).
Be sure to [add some credit](/platform/dashboard/guides/trial-mode/) to test with.

### Add a new Resource

<AddResource/>

### Create a SWML Script

From the Resources menu, select **SWML Script**.
Name it something fun and recognizable.
Ours is titled Rime Wizard.

Next, paste the following starter script into the text box, and hit <kbd>Save</kbd>:

```yaml andJson
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - ai:
        prompt:
          text: You're Celeste, a voice from Rime's Mist v2 model! Introduce yourself, and have a conversation about programmable communications on the SignalWire platform.
        languages:
          - name: Celeste
            code: en-US
            voice: rime.celeste
```

<!--
```
        params:
          rime_model: arcana
```

This simple YAML file is actually a complete application that SignalWire hosts and deploys the moment you hit save. 
The hard telecom and LLM integration happen behind the scenes, 
so all you have to worry about is calling the ai method, giving it a prompt, and assigning a TTS voice. 
In this case, we’re using Rime’s Celeste voice.

SWML is compact but mighty. 
This same SWML script can be expanded to do almost anything - 
call external APIs, 
use defined “tools” or functions, 
retrieve structured information from SignalWire’s 
[Datasphere](https://signalwire.com/blogs/developers/signalwire-datasphere-build-specialized-ai) RAG stack, 
switch voices and contexts, 
programmatically modify its own source with the 
[Prompt Object Model](/ai/pom/), 
and transfer to other [Resources](/platform/call-fabric/resources) on SignalWire’s Call Fabric platform.

### Buy and assign a phone number

Navigate to the **Phone Numbers** section of the Dashboard's left sidebar menu.

Purchase a phone number and assign it to the desired SWML script.

### Give it a call!

Call the number you just assigned to chat with your new AI voice application on the phone.

## Next steps with SWML

Now you've deployed your very first SignalWire voice AI application using Rime voices. 
Next, dive deeper into SWML to explore its capabilities!
