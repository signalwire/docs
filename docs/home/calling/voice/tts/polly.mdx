# Amazon Polly

Amazon Web Services' Polly TTS engine includes several models to accommodate different use cases.
SignalWire supports the Standard and Neural models:

- [Standard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/standard-voices.html)
is a traditional, cost-effective, and reliable TTS model.
It is less natural-sounding but more budget-friendly than Polly Neural. Example voice identifier string: `polly.Emma`
- [Neural](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/neural-voices.html)
is an advanced model designed to produce speech that is more natural and closer to human-like pronunciation and intonation. Example voice identifier string: `polly.Emma-Neural`

:::warning Amazon Polly limits
Amazon Polly has a limit of 3000 chargeable characters in a single request.
If your TTS request is longer than 3000 characters, you will experience silence.
:::

## Languages

Most Amazon Polly voices support a single language.
Select a language by choosing from the [list of supported voices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/available-voices.html).

All Amazon Polly voices support [accented bilingual pronunciation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/bilingual-voices.html#accented-bilingual)
through the use of the SSML `lang` tag.

Amazon Polly also offers some [fully bilingual voices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/bilingual-voices.html#true-bilingual)
designed to fluently speak two languages.

## Voice IDs

Polly voices are identified by the voice name (like `Amy`, `Matthew`, `Mia`, `Zhiyu`, etc ) only,
except when the voice exists in multiple models. 
In that case, append a code after a dash `-` to specify variations of the model, like `neural`.
If no model code is specified, the Standard model will be used.

| Example string         | Model used |
| :--------------------- | :--------- |
| `polly.Amy`            | Standard   |
| `polly.Amy-Neural`     | Neural     |

## Examples

See how to use Amazon Polly voices on the SignalWire platform.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="swml" label="SWML">
Use the
[**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages#use-voice-strings)
SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai).
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:
        - name: English
          code: en-US
          voice: polly.Ruth-Neural
```
Alternatively, use the [**`say_voice`** parameter](/swml/methods/play#parameters) 
of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play)
SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - set:
      say_voice: "polly.Ruth-Neural"
  - play: "say:Greetings. This is the Ruth voice from Amazon Polly's Neural text-to-speech model."
```
