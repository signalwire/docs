## Create a SIP Endpoint

You can create a SIP endpoint manually within your SignalWire Space or programmatically through the [Create A SIP Endpoint API](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/create-sip-endpoint).

If you want to create a SIP endpoint in your SignalWire space, visit the "Resources" tab from the sidebar, and create a new Resource.

![Add new Resource](@image/dashboard/resources/add-new-resource.webp)

There, select "New SIP Endpoint" to create a new SIP endpoint.

You will need to set a few things; the username you will register your SIP endpoint as, a password to authenticate your endpoint when registering, 
which SignalWire or verified phone number you would like to show when dialing a PSTN number (if left blank, a random number from your purchased numbers will be chosen), 
encryption status, an outbound call policy (whether to allow calls to PSTN), and the default codecs/ciphers you would like to use.

:::tip

To quickly get started, you can just set the `SIP address` and `Password` fields, and leave the rest default.

Alternatively, you can create a SIP endpoint programmatically by making a POST request to the SIP Endpoint resource. The following request will use default advanced settings.

```bash
curl https://your-space.signalwire.com/api/relay/rest/endpoints/sip \
  -X POST \
  -u 'YourProjectID:YourAuthToken' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "username" : "c3p0",
    "password" : "yavinOrBust",
    "caller_id" : "C-3P0"
  }'
```

import NewLegacy from '/docs/_common/dashboard/_ui-admonition.mdx'

<NewLegacy />

If you are on the Legacy UI, create a SIP Endpoint by going to the "SIP" tab from the sidebar, and creating a new SIP Endpoint.

## Register SIP Endpoint to a SignalWire Phone Number

After creating a SIP Endpoint, you can register it to a phone number in the Space for calls to function properly. Navigate to the [Phone Numbers tab](https://my.signalwire.com?page=phone_numbers), click the phone number
that you would like to register, and then click `Edit Settings` button. From here, in the
`Handling Inbound Calls` setting, select `Assign Resource` from the dropdown and choose the SIP endpoint you created.

Click Save, and you are ready to make a call to your SIP endpoint!

that you would like to register, and then click `Edit Settings` button. From here, in the
`Handle Incoming Calls` section, select `SIP Endpoint`, then input the SIP address you created.

## Dial a SIP Endpoint Using one of SignalWires Products

SignalWire offers a number of products that are capable of dialing a SIP endpoint.

Instead of setting your phone number to a `SIP ENDPOINT` underneath the  `Handle Calls Using` section,
you can set it to one of the above products to dial your SIP endpoint.

SignalWire offers this capability through the following products:


- [**SWML Scripts**](/swml) - A simple markup language written in either `JSON` or `YAML`
for creating SignalWire applications.
  - Use the [`connect` method](/swml/methods/connect) to connect a call to a sip endpoint
- [**Call Flow Builder**](/call-flow-builder) - A visual tool for creating SignalWire Call applications.
  - Use the [`Forward to Phone`](/call-flow-builder/forward-to-phone#forward-to-sip) node to connect a call to a sip endpoint
- [**Relay Browser Applications**](/sdks/reference/browser-sdk/) - A JavaScript SDK for creating SignalWire applications in the browser utilizing SignalWires WebSocket APIs.
- Use the [`dial` method](/sdks/reference/browser-sdk/SignalWire%20Client/client/#dial) to dial a resource address that's linked to a SIP endpoint.
- [**Relay Server Applications**](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk) - A Node.js SDK for creating SignalWire applications on the server utilizing SignalWires WebSocket APIs.
  - Use the [`connectSip` method](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk/relay-v4/voice/voice-call#connectsip) to connect an existing call to a sip endpoint.
  - Use the [`dialSip` method](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk/relay-v4/voice/voice-client#dialsip) to create a new call to a sip endpoint.
- [**cXML Scripts/Applications**](/compatibility-api/guides/general/creating-and-using-cxml-applications) - Compatible cXML scripts for creating SignalWire applications.
Great for users looking to migrate from a TwiML-based application.
  - Use the `Sip` noun to [dial a SIP endpoint](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/sip-noun) from an XML Bin.
- [**REST API**](/rest) - A RESTful API for creating SignalWire applications. You can host your own webhook server to
use these REST APIs.
  - SignalWire REST API to [create a call](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/calling/calls-create) to your SIP endpoint.
  - Compatibility REST API to [create a call](/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints/create-a-call) to your SIP endpoint.
