# SIP Gateways

A SIP Gateway is a [Resource](/docs/home/platform/call-fabric/resources/index.mdx)
on SignalWire's Call Fabric platform that allows you to forward calls to external SIP addresses.
Follow this guide to create and configure a SIP Gateway in your SignalWire Dashboard, 
and register it to a SignalWire phone number or other Resource Address.

:::tip 
SIP Gateways are designed to route calls to external SIP Addresses.
They are distinct from [SIP Domain Applications](/voice/getting-started/sip/sip-domain-applications), which route inbound calls to SignalWire SIP addresses,
and [SIP Endpoints](/voice/sip/get-started), which are for registering your devices to SignalWire SIP addresses.

    To get started, login to the [SignalWire Dashboard](https://my.signalwire.com).
    If you have multiple Spaces, select the one you want to use for this guide.

<Steps>

### Open the Resources tab

<AddResource/>

### Create a new Resource

From within the Resources tab, click **Add New**, and select **SIP Gateway**.

### Assign a phone number

Once the SIP Gateway is saved, you can also assign 
[Addresses](/platform/call-fabric/addresses)
to it, such as phone numbers, other SIP addresses, or aliases.
Calls made to an Address assigned to the SIP Gateway will be seamlessly and instantly forwarded to the configured SIP address.

To test this, we will assign a phone number.
Navigate to the [Phone Numbers tab](https://my.signalwire.com?page=phone_numbers), click the phone number
that you would like to register, and then click `Edit Settings` button. 
From here, in the **Handling Inbound Calls** setting, select **Assign Resource** from the dropdown and choose the SIP Gateway you created.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Select **Save**. 
That's it!
Your new SIP Gateway will now forward incoming calls to the assigned SIP address.

### Try it out

Try calling the assigned phone number. 
SignalWire will forward the call to the device associated with the gateway's SIP address!

</Steps>

## Forward calls from other SignalWire Resources

Now that you have successfully created and tested your first SIP Gateway, it's time to integrate it into your application.

Since SIP Gateways are Resources on the SignalWire platform, you can assign multiple Addresses to a given SIP Gateway.
SignalWire will forward calls made to any of those addresses - 
whether a phone number, another SIP address, or an alias - 
to the configured destination.
