# Get started with SIP

Follow this guide to create a SIP endpoint in your SignalWire Dashboard, 
register it to a SignalWire phone number for handling incoming calls, 
or dial it via a number of SignalWire products.

## Create a SIP endpoint

<div className="row">
  
  <div className="col col--6">
    To get started, login to the [SignalWire Dashboard](https://my.signalwire.com).
    If you have multiple Spaces, select the one you want to use for this guide.
  </div>
  
  <div className="col col--6">
    :::note
    Want to create a SIP endpoint programmatically instead? Use the [Create A SIP Endpoint API](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/space/create-sip-endpoint).

<Steps>

### Open the Resources tab

<AddResource/>

### Create a new Resource

From within the Resources tab, click **Add New**, and select **SIP Endpoint**.

<Frame>
  ![Add new SIP Endpoint Resource](@image/dashboard/resources/add-new-resource-sip-marked.png)
</Frame>

Set the following details:
| Value | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| SIP Address <span className="required-arg">Required</span> | The SIP address for this endpoint. |
| Password <span className="required-arg">Required</span> | A password to authenticate your endpoint |
| Caller ID | A SignalWire or verified phone number to show when dialing a PSTN number <br/>*If left blank, a random number from your purchased numbers will be chosen* |
| Encryption status | Set encryption to Required or Optional |
| Outbound Call Handler | Whether to allow calls to the PSTN |
| Codecs and Ciphers | The default codecs/ciphers you would like to use |

:::tip

To quickly get started, you can just set the `SIP Address` and `Password` fields, and leave the rest default.

### Assign to a SignalWire phone number

After creating a SIP Endpoint, you can register it to a phone number in the Space for calls to function properly. Navigate to the [Phone Numbers tab](https://my.signalwire.com?page=phone_numbers), click the phone number
that you would like to register, and then click `Edit Settings` button. From here, in the
`Handling Inbound Calls` setting, select `Assign Resource` from the dropdown and choose the SIP endpoint you created.

</Frame>

Click Save, and you are ready to make a call to your SIP endpoint!

### Dial the SIP endpoint

SignalWire offers a number of products that are capable of dialing a SIP endpoint.

Instead of setting your phone number to a `SIP ENDPOINT` underneath the  `Handle Calls Using` section,
you can set it to one of the above products to dial your SIP endpoint.

SignalWire offers this capability through the following products:


- [**SWML Scripts**](/swml) - A simple markup language written in either `JSON` or `YAML`
for creating SignalWire applications.
  - Use the [`connect` method](/swml/methods/connect) to connect a call to a sip endpoint
- [**Call Flow Builder**](/call-flow-builder) - A visual tool for creating SignalWire Call applications.
  - Use the [`Forward to Phone`](/call-flow-builder/forward-to-phone#forward-to-sip) node to connect a call to a SIP endpoint
- [**Relay Browser Applications**](/sdks/reference/browser-sdk/) - A JavaScript SDK for creating SignalWire applications in the browser utilizing SignalWires WebSocket APIs.
- Use the [`dial` method](/sdks/reference/browser-sdk/SignalWire%20Client/client/#dial) to dial a resource address that's linked to a SIP endpoint.
- [**Relay Server Applications**](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk) - A Node.js SDK for creating SignalWire applications on the server utilizing SignalWires WebSocket APIs.
  - Use the [`connectSip` method](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk/voice/call#connectsip) to connect an existing call to a sip endpoint.
  - Use the [`dialSip` method](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk/voice/client#dialsip) to create a new call to a sip endpoint.
- [**cXML Scripts/Applications**](/compatibility-api/guides/general/creating-and-using-cxml-scripts) - Compatible cXML scripts for creating SignalWire applications.
Great for users looking to migrate from a TwiML-based application.
  - Use the `Sip` noun to [dial a SIP endpoint](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/sip-noun) from an XML Bin.
- [**REST API**](/rest) - A RESTful API for creating SignalWire applications. You can host your own webhook server to
use these REST APIs.
  - SignalWire REST API to [create a call](/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/calling/calls-create) to your SIP endpoint.
  - Compatibility REST API to [create a call](/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints/create-a-call) to your SIP endpoint.
