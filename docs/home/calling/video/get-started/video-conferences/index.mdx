# Video Conferences

[//]: # "Please avoid changing section headings, title, or page slug as this will break links from the Space UI"

The SignalWire Video APIs give you full flexibility to build your own personalized video conferencing experience. But if you need a simpler level of personalization, and you want to get started fast, you can use Video Conferences.

<Frame caption = "With Video Conferences you get a ready-to-use UI which includes device selectors, recording, screen sharing, participants list, and more. And if you need to, you can always extend them with custom code.">

A Video Conference is a pre-built videoconferencing room that you can create from your SignalWire Space UI. No code is required. You can configure the style and features of the room, and you can share links for joining it. You can even embed it in your CMS like WordPress, Drupal, or any other kind of static HTML page, simply by copy-pasting a snippet of HTML code.

And if you realize later that you need more control, with Video Conferences you can always use custom JavaScript code to access the low-level API, the same that you get while using our SDKs.

## Using Video Conferences {#using-video-conferences}

To create a new conference room, log into your SignalWire Space, go to the _Video_ section, then select the _Video Conferences_ tab. From here, you can click on the _New_ button to create a Video Conference.

After selecting a name, you are redirected to the configuration page for that Conference room.

Buttons show options to 'Join Room as Moderator', 'Copy Moderator Link', 'Moderator Embed Code', 'Copy Moderator Token', and 'Reset Tokens'. A preview of the Video Conference is shown on the right.](@image/video/conference-overview.webp)

On the right, you see a preview of the room's content. Note that this will be enabled only if you have enabled room previews.

On the left, you find buttons for using your room.

**Join Room As Moderator**  
Pressing this button allows you to join the video room with moderator permissions. Pressing the downwards arrow lets you join with guest permissions instead.

**Copy Moderator Link**  
Pressing this button copies a link for joining the room with moderator permissions. Pressing the downwards arrow lets you copy the link for joining with guest permissions instead.

**Moderator Embed Code**  
Pressing this button copies a code snippet for embedding the video room into any web page. By default, the code snippet will make users join with moderator permissions. Pressing the downwards arrow lets you copy the code for joining with guest permissions instead. You could decide to embed these into different pages of your website, one internal and one accessible by the public.

**Copy Moderator Token**  
Pressing this button copies the room token which can be used programmatically to grant access to the room with moderator permissions. Pressing the downwards arrow lets you copy the token for joining with guest permissions instead. You may need these tokens if you alter the embedded code.

**Reset Tokens**  
Pressing this button will reset the security tokens associated with a room. Press this button if you want to disable existing access to the room. Note that resetting the tokens will require you to update all the code snippets and links that you previously shared since they will stop working.

## Configuring Video Conferences {#configuring-video-conferences}

In the second section, you will find two tabs to help you customize your room.

<Frame caption="Configuration options for Video Conferences.">
![This screenshot shows the configuration options for Video Conferences. At the top of the screen, there are two tabs: 'Settings' and 'Appearance'. Under the selected 'Settings' tab, there are the following options. 'Availability' sets the dates and times that members will be able to enter the room. There are also settings for Quality, Layout, Size, and Record on Start.](@image/video/conference-settings.png)
</Frame>

### Settings Tab {#settings-tab}

In this tab, you will find options to customize how your room is built.

**Availability** sets a specific time the room will be accessible. If you want to limit accessibility to a specific event time, input the starting and ending date and time using your local format or click on the calendar icon to set them.

**Quality** allows you to set a lower or higher video quality depending on your bandwidth and system capabilities.

**Layout** controls the arrangement of participant video tiles. This will be the same layout for all users. The default is a responsive grid.

**Size** limits the number of participants allowed to join the room. A small size will cap the number of participants at 10, medium size at 50, and large size at 300. After the limit is reached, no other participants can join the room.

**Record on Start** starts a recording as soon as the room is opened. Recordings are accessible later in the Recordings tab in the Video section of your SignalWire Space.

**Enable Room Preview** allows a short recording of the room content to be recorded and displayed to participants before joining the room.

### Appearance Tab {#appearance-tab}

In this tab, you can customize the colors used in your room. There is a color picker for Background, Foreground, Primary, Success Indications, and Error Indications. You can use the preview to test out your choices.
