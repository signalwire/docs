# Creating a Video Room

With SignalWire you can create video rooms to host video conferences in just a
few clicks. In this guide, we will focus on video rooms with UI included (also
called Programmable Video Conferences): this allows you to get started without
writing any code.

Video rooms with UI included come in the form of a widget that you can embed in
any kind of webpage. Share the URL of the page, and people will be able to join
the room.

If, instead of a widget, you are interested in advanced use cases (such as a
custom UI, or a custom authentication mechanism), take a look at [First steps with Video](../video-first-steps/index.mdx). It will show you how to write a custom
video application from scratch using our lower level APIs.

## What do you need to get started?

To use our Video Conferences you just need:

1. A SignalWire Space. If you do not have one, [click here to learn how to create your own SignalWire Space](/platform/dashboard/getting-started/signing-up-for-a-space);
2. A web page or web space with support for custom HTML and JavaScript.

:::info You have a website? Our Video Conferences are compatible!

Video Conferences can be embedded in your CMS like **WordPress**, **Ghost**, **Drupal**, or any other kind of **HTML page**.

## Obtaining the code to paste on your website

You can get the code snippet for your Video Conference Widget by logging into
your [SignalWire Space](https://signalwire.com/signin) and going to the
**Video** section from the left sidebar. Within the "Conferences" tab, select or
create a new room (with UI included). Finally, click on the dropdown menu next to
**Moderator Embed Code** and click on **Guest Embed Code** to copy the code. A
screen like the following will open:

You can copy either the code for guests, or the code for accessing the room with moderator permissions. How do they differ?

|                                | Guests | Moderators |
| -----------------------------: | :----: | :--------: |
|                Join/Leave Room |   ✅   |     ✅     |
|              Mute/Unmute Audio |   ✅   |     ✅     |
|        Start/Stop Webcam Video |   ✅   |     ✅     |
|                   Share Screen |   ❌   |     ✅     |
| Mute/Unmute Other Users' Audio |   ❌   |     ✅     |
|  Start/Stop Other Users' Video |   ❌   |     ✅     |
|  Start/Stop Recording The Room |   ❌   |     ✅     |

:::caution Moderator Code Snippets and Publicly Available Pages

Since your room's Moderator code snippet gives website visitors permissions over other users, you should never copy it to publicly available pages. Essentially, you could decide to embed these into different pages of your website, one internal (for the Moderator code snippet) and one accessible by the public (for Guests).

## Making Video Conferences your own

You can change the look of your Video Conferences in the **Appearance** tab. There are two color schemes available: light and dark, and you can change them accordingly so they fit the look of your web page depending on the time of day.

## Wrap Up

Video Conferences are an easy way to integrate a videoconferencing experience into any web page, without advanced software development experience. All you need to do is copy and paste a snippet of code.

Video Conferences already include a UI. If you are building a more complex
application, you may be interested instead in building a custom UI yourself.
Read [First steps with Video](../video-first-steps/index.mdx) for more information on
that.
