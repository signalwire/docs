# Programmable Video Conferences

<Subtitle>Create and deploy a no-code or low-code video conference room</Subtitle><br/><br/>

import ResourcesCard from '/docs/_common/call-fabric/resources-fyi-card.mdx';
import LegacyInstructions from './_legacy-pvc.mdx';

The SignalWire platform offers powerful video conferencing tools 
built on the MCU (Multipoint Control Unit) architecture to enable low-latency audio/video conferencing. 
Each participant sends one video stream to SignalWire and receives one stream in return,
reducing the load on the end-user and ensuring all clients see the same video feed. 

## Create a room

To get started, login to the [SignalWire Dashboard](https://my.signalwire.com).
If you have multiple Spaces, select the one to which you want to associate this video conference.

<Steps>

### Open the Resources tab

:::info No Resources tab?
If you don't see the **Resources** tab, your SignalWire Space is on the **Legacy Dashboard**.
Refer to the [Legacy](#legacy) section of this guide for instructions for your Dashboard and information about the migration.

</Steps>

## Embed the conference {#embed}

Now you're ready to embed the video room code in your website.
Here are some examples on how to use the code that we have copied, depending on the technology behind your website.
Refer to your site's documentation for comprehensive instructions on embedding code.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Static HTML page">
    Paste the snippet of code inside the `<body>` of your page, in the position where you want it to appear. 
    If you need to, you can control the size and position of the widget by wrapping it in a properly styled `div` element. 
    For example, to make sure that the size is exactly 400px x 250px and that the widget is horizontally centered:

    ```html
    <div style="margin: 0 auto; width: 400px; height: 250px;">
      [paste here your snippet of code]
    </div>
    ```

    To learn more about the ways you can make more advanced changes to your code snippet, consult the
    [Video Conference Technical Reference](/video/conference/technical-reference).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="WordPress">
    Integrating video meetings in WordPress to meet with your team or your customers has never been easier than with Video Conferences! 
    You can add your Video Conference guest code to any page or post, using the **Custom HTML** block. 
    Paste the code snippet in the HTML block, and you are ready to go.

    </Frame>

    #### Restricting access to your moderator page

    Since we do not want everyone to have Moderator permissions, we can create an extra page, for internal use only, by making it Private and only visible to Administrators and Editors.

    <Frame caption="How to make a page private.">
      ![An animated Gif showing a private WordPress page with the Moderator Video Conference code in an HTML block.](@image/external/wp-private-page.gif)
    </Frame>

    #### Restricting access to your guest page

    You can password-protect your guest page to only allow certain people to join in. This has the benefit of having a consistent meeting link, but with the added benefit of changing the page password as needed.

    </Frame>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ghost">
    Conferencing with readers in Ghost is very simple. 
    To turn any post into a meeting/conference page all you need to do is add the guest code to an **HTML card**.

    <Frame caption="How to add the code snippet to a post using the HTML card.">

## Moderator and Guest permissions

Moderators and Guests have different permissions.
Make sure to select the right one when copying the embed code.

|                                | Guests | Moderators |
| :----------------------------- | :----: | :--------: |
|                Join/Leave Room |   ✅   |     ✅     |
|              Mute/Unmute Audio |   ✅   |     ✅     |
|        Start/Stop Webcam Video |   ✅   |     ✅     |
|                   Share Screen |   ❌   |     ✅     |
| Mute/Unmute Other Users' Audio |   ❌   |     ✅     |
|  Start/Stop Other Users' Video |   ❌   |     ✅     |
|  Start/Stop Recording The Room |   ❌   |     ✅     |

:::caution Moderator Code Snippets and Publicly Available Pages

Since your room's Moderator code snippet gives website visitors permissions over other users, you should never copy it to publicly available pages. Essentially, you could decide to embed these into different pages of your website, one internal (for the Moderator code snippet) and one accessible by the public (for Guests).
