### AI

SignalWire AI services weave together LLMs, text-to-speech, speech-to-text and other AI services with PSTN, SIP, and WebRTC 
using a powerful underlying Call Fabric architecture and a comprehensive markup language called SWML.

AI Agents can call functions and connect to APIs with <Tooltips tip="SignalWire AI Gateway">SWAIG</Tooltips>, 
utilize the Datasphere <Tooltips tip="Retrieval Automated Generation">RAG</Tooltips> stack,
and programmatically adjust their own prompts using <Tooltips tip="Prompt Object Model">POM</Tooltips>.
