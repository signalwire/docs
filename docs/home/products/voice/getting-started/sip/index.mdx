## Overview

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time communication sessions. 
These sessions can include voice and video applications over the Internet. 

SIP is fundamental to modern Voice over IP (VoIP) communications and enables features such as:

- Voice and video calls
- Conference calling
- Presence information
- Multimedia distribution

Getting started with SIP involves understanding a few key components:
- SIP endpoints (phones, softphones, or applications)
- SIP servers (proxies, registrars)
- Network requirements
