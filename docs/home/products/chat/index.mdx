The SignalWire Chat API is a flexible IP Message Bus that you can use to send and receive messages.

## PubSub

The most basic chat functionality is provided in a **PubSub** environment, which has two main components: **Channels** and **Messages**. Messages are published to a channel and the new message event is available to any subscribers. This means the publishers and subscribers are isolated and do not need to know where the messages are coming from or being read. If this sounds like the messaging model that meets your needs, check out our PubSub service.

## Chat

**Chat** service extends PubSub with a third main component: **Members**.

You can create channels, members can subscribe to those channels, and they can send attributed messages that every other subscriber will be able to see. Members can even carry state. If this model better suits your needs, Chat is for you!
