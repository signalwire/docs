## Toll-Free Number Overview

A great alternative to using a Short Code or a 10DLC (local area code) number is a Toll-Free number. Toll-Free US numbers can be used for business messaging to all major US carriers, as well as most major mobile Canadian carriers.

A no-cost
[verification](https://support.signalwire.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=13501768371227)
process needs to be completed for all Toll-Free numbers before being permitted
to send any messages. Pending and unverified numbers are no longer be able to freely send messages.

:::

As a rule of thumb, some [categories of messaging are forbidden](/messaging/getting-started/sms-best-practices-how-to-ensure-message-delivery) on SignalWire. Please take the time to review our list of explicitly prohibited content before submitting your application for Toll-Free, 10DLC, and Short Code.

Downstream message filtering is designed to prevent unwanted messaging, fraud, and abuse. Before considering verifying your Toll-Free number, please be sure to follow the [CTIA guidelines and best messaging practices](https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/230523-CTIA-Messaging-Principles-and-Best-Practices-FINAL.pdf).

The following standards must be followed for Toll-Free messaging:

- Obtain clear opt-in consent from your recipients before sending messages
- Provide an easy way for your recipients to opt-out of receiving messages
- Avoid using shortened URLs. It's highly recommended to use a full branded URL as well as URLs that lead back to a legitimate website that contains branding, a privacy policy, terms of service, and contact information. Publicly hosted URL shorteners are forbidden and are guaranteed to cause spam blocks
- Using multiple Toll-Free numbers to send the same or similar content to bypass throughput limitations is known as **snowshoeing**. This is **highly prohibited** by carriers. If you need to [increase your throughput](https://signalwire.com/products/cloud-messaging/high-throughput-messaging#:~:text=With%20SignalWire%20High-Throughput%20Messaging,with%20Toll-Free%20numbers%20only), it can be approved by our Sales team. If you have a valid use case for using multiple Toll-Free numbers (such as multiple locations all requiring an individual Toll-Free number), this is something we may be able to work out with our carriers.

### What is Toll-Free Verification?

Getting your Toll-Free number verified means that your business and use case has been reviewed and vetted prior to sending messaging via Toll-Free and that your content has received carrier approval.

:::info

Please note that the verification process is free of charge.

:::

Having your Toll-Free numbers verified will greatly reduce the risk of spam filtering on Toll-Free traffic towards all major mobile carriers in the US, as well as most major mobile carriers in Canada, so long as you stick with the content you submitted for verification and continue to follow SignalWire's [messaging best practices](https://signalwire.com/resources/guides/a2p-messaging-use-case-best-practices) and [code of conduct](https://signalwire.com/legal/messaging-code-of-conduct). Deviation from your verification registration can still result in spam filtering. **Verified does not mean whitelisted.** 

Verification affects messaging to mobile subscribers in the United States as well as Fido, Rogers, Telus, and Videotron in Canada.

Note: Other (non-US/Canada) countries do not treat Toll-Free SMS any differently than other international SMS, and you should consult that country's SMS Guidelines page to learn more about compliance considerations for messaging.

If you are an ISV, for example, and need to complete verification for multiple customers/multiple numbers, please [download this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_LXQ1oXjybbB9YbdBQxfHuoBZIdyI2Bg/edit#gid=1315500553) and fill out the required information for each number. To download, click File > Download > Microsoft Excel (.xlsx). Once you're ready to submit, send the form to support@signalwire.com and our Carrier Operations team will be in touch with you!

### Is there an API available?

Currently (as of March 2024), there is no API available for submitting Toll-Free verification requests.

### Does TCR (The Campaign Registry) process Toll-Free Verifications?

No, TCR is not involved with Toll-Free verifications. A specific Toll-Free
Aggregator handles Toll-Free messaging for the industry and is unrelated to TCR.

### Why does Canada have stricter requirements?

Canada is more restrictive because of its anti-spam laws and the policies
implemented by mobile carriers to meet the law.

### Is legal language required somewhere on the brand's website about messaging?

Toll-Free Verification and the downstream provider require legal language to be found somewhere on the brand's website about messaging. You will have to provide a link to your
company's terms and conditions and your privacy policy.

### How long does it take for the Toll-Free verification process?

It can take up to 2 weeks, from start to finish.

### If my Toll-Free number is verified, does that guarantee deliverability?

No, your verified Toll-Free number is subject to limited filtering. If your
content is flagged as spam, that specific content will be blocked, but not the
Toll-Free number.
