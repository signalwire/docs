# Sending Your First SMS

Let's get you started by sending your first SMS. In this guide we are going to
use [Compatibility APIs](/rest/compatibility-api): if you are
migrating from a different provider, these APIs will likely be very similar. In
case you need more advanced features, check out our [Realtime APIs](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk/guides/messaging/first-steps-with-messaging).

## Your API Credentials

To send messages, make phone calls, and programmatically control video rooms,
you need API credentials. Find these in your [SignalWire Space](https://signalwire.com/signin), within the "API" tab on the left sidebar.
If this is the first time you are using API credentials, you will need to create
an API token.

<Frame caption="You can find your Project ID, Space URL, and API Token from the API tab in your SignalWire Space. Make sure your token has the necessary scopes enabled.">

![The API page.](@image/dashboard/credentials/api-credentials.webp)

</Frame>


In the "API" section you will find all the information you'll need. In particular:

- Your Project ID (e.g., `7b981d06-fa9e-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`)
- Your Space URL (e.g., `yourname.signalwire.com`)
- Your API Token (e.g., `PTda745ebXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)

The API Token is confidential: keep it private.

## Obtaining a number

[Log in](https://signalwire.com/signin) to your SignalWire Space. From the Phone
Numbers section, you can [buy a new phone number](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number) if
you don't have one already. You will need at least one number to send and
receive messages.

Make sure the number you are buying supports SMS messaging, and you're good.

## Sending a message

Let's see how to send your first message. You have a few different options: you
can trigger an HTTP request yourself (using cURL or the dedicated functions in
your preferred programming language), or you can use [one of our SDKs](/sdks). We'll show examples for both methods.

### Installation

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs groupId="your-first-api-calls">

<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

> Refer to https://everything.curl.dev/get.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript" default>

```bash
npm install @signalwire/compatibility-api
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```bash
pip install signalwire
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```bash
composer require signalwire-community/signalwire
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Once your environment is set up, you can proceed with your first API call.

### Sending

To send a message, you can use the [Create a Message](/rest/compatibility-api/endpoints/create-message) endpoint from our
[Compatibility APIs](https://developer.signalwire.com/compatibility-api/).

:::info Ensuring message delivery

If you are sending messages to the US from a 10DLC number, you _must_ register
your traffic with the Campaign Registry. Otherwise, the carriers will not
deliver your messages. Please see [**Campaign Registry - Everything You Need To Know**](/messaging/get-started/campaign-registry) for more information.

Let's see how to send a message with a REST API call:

<Tabs groupId="your-first-api-calls">

<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl "https://$SPACE_URL/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/$PROJECT_ID/Messages" \
  -X POST \
  -u "$PROJECT_ID:$API_TOKEN" \
  --data-urlencode "From=$FROM_NUMBER" \
  --data-urlencode "To=$TO_NUMBER" \
  --data-urlencode 'Body=Hello'
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const { RestClient } = require("@signalwire/compatibility-api");
const client = RestClient(PROJECT_ID, API_TOKEN, { signalwireSpaceUrl: SPACE_URL });
client.messages
  .create({ from: FROM_NUMBER, to: TO_NUMBER, body: "Hello" })
  .then((message) => console.log(message.sid))
  .done();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from signalwire.rest import Client as signalwire_client
client = signalwire_client(PROJECT_ID, API_TOKEN, signalwire_space_url = SPACE_URL)
message = client.messages.create(
                              from_=FROM_NUMBER,
                              to=TO_NUMBER,
                              body='Hello'
                          )
print(message.sid)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```php
<?php
  use SignalWire\Rest\Client;
  $client = new Client($PROJECT_ID, $API_TOKEN, array("signalwireSpaceUrl" => $SPACE_URL));
  $message = $client->messages
                    ->create($TO_NUMBER, // to
                             array("from" => $FROM_NUMBER, "body" => "Hello")
                    );
  print($message->sid);
?>
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Make sure to replace all placeholders with your own values.

This example used the [Compatibility API](pathname:///compatibility-api), and in
particular the [Compatibility REST API](/rest/compatibility-api), to
send a message. For more advanced, real-time applications, you'll want to check
out our [Realtime SDK](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk/relay-v4).
