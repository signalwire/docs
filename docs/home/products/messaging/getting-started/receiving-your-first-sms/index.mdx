# Receiving Your First SMS

To [send your first SMS](/messaging/getting-started/sending-your-first-sms), you needed a
phone number, API credentials, and a REST API call.

Receiving messages works a bit differently: when using the cXML API,
you need to prepare an XML file with instructions on what to do after a message
is received on a given phone number.

        1) the user sends a message to a number in your SignalWire Space.
        2) SignalWire fetches the XML bin URL associated with the destination number.
        3) The contents of the XML bin are interpreted and executed.
        4) Any response specified in the XML bin will reach the caller.

## cXML Applications

Let's write our first XML bin. We will host this one on SignalWire (you can use
your own server if you want, which even allows you to generate bins
dynamically).

You can create and manage bins from the LaML section of your Dashboard under the
Bins tab.

<figure>
  <img
    className="img-800"
    src={
      require("@site/docs/home/products/voice/getting-started/how-to-set-up-voicemail/xml-bins.webP")
        .default
    }
    alt="A screenshot of the LaML page with the Bins tab circled in red."
  />
  <figcaption>cXML applications tab of the LaML section</figcaption>
</figure>

Create a new bin, and use the following lines as content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <Message>Hello from SignalWire!</Message>
</Response>
```

The bin above will reply with a fixed message to any incoming SMS. Find the full technical reference in the [Compatibility XML](compatibility-api/cxml/index.mdx) section.

Copy the Request URL of the bin you just created, then read the next section to configure a number to handle messages using that bin.

## Configuring your number {#configuring-your-number}

The last step is connecting a number to the bin. If you don't have a phone
number yet, make sure to [buy one](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number). You
will need at least one number to receive messages.

Then, open the settings for the number. Under "Messaging Settings", choose to
handle messages using "LaML Webhooks", then paste the URL of the bin in the
field below.

<figure>
    <img className="img-800" src={require("./number-messaging-settings.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the Phone Numbers page. 'Handle Messages Using' is set to LaML Webhooks. 'When a Message Comes In' is set to the URL of the LaML bin." />

Try sending a message to the configured phone number: after a few seconds you'll receive an automated reply.

:::info Ensuring message delivery

If you are sending messages to the US from a 10DLC number, you _must_ register
your traffic with the Campaign Registry. Otherwise, the carriers will not
deliver your messages. Please see [**Campaign Registry - Everything You Need To Know**](/messaging/get-started/campaign-registry) for more information.

## Wrap up

We have shown how to receive a text message and perform follow-up actions.

This example used the [Compatibility API](/compatibility-api), and in
particular [cXML](compatibility-api/cxml/index.mdx) bins, to receive
a message. For more advanced, real-time applications, you'll want to check out
our [Realtime SDK](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk/relay-v4).
