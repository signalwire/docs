# Receiving Your First SMS

To [send your first SMS](/messaging/getting-started/sending-your-first-sms), you needed a
phone number, API credentials, and a REST API call.

Receiving messages works a bit differently: when using the cXML API,
you need to prepare an XML file with instructions on what to do after a message
is received on a given phone number.

## cXML Applications

Let's write our first cXML script. We will host this one on SignalWire (you can use
your own server if you want, which even allows you to generate scripts 
dynamically).

Navigate to the "Resources" tab from the sidebar and create a new Resource. There, 
select the resource type of "Script", and pick "cXML script". 

<Frame>
![Create a new cXML script.](@image/dashboard/resources/new-cxml-bin.png)
</Frame>

There, you can paste the following XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <Message>Hello from SignalWire!</Message>
</Response>
```

The script will reply with a fixed message to any incoming SMS. Find the full technical reference in the [Compatibility XML](compatibility-api/cxml/index.mdx) section.

Copy the Request URL of the script you just created, then read the next section to configure a number to handle messages using that bin.

import NewLegacy from '/docs/home/platform/dashboard/_ui-admonition.mdx'

<NewLegacy />

<Accordion title="For Legacy UI">

Navigate to the "LaML/cXML" section of your Dashboard and create a new cXML bin with the content above.

<Frame>
![Create a new cXML script.](@image/dashboard/legacy/xml-bins.png)
</Frame>

</Accordion>

## Configuring your number {#configuring-your-number}

The last step is connecting a number to the bin. If you don't have a phone
number yet, make sure to [buy one](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number). You
will need at least one number to receive messages.

Navigate to the "Phone Numbers" section of your Dashboard and open the settings for the number you want to configure.
There, assign the cXML script you just created to handle messages.

<Frame>
![Open the settings for the number.](@image/dashboard/phone-numbers/assign-resource-full.png)
</Frame>

<NewLegacy />

<Accordion title="For Legacy UI">

Open the settings for the number you want to configure. Under "Messaging Settings", choose to
handle messages using "LaML Webhooks". In the dropdown, select the cXML script you just created.

</Accordion>


Try sending a message to the configured phone number: after a few seconds you'll receive an automated reply.

:::info Ensuring message delivery

If you are sending messages to the US from a 10DLC number, you _must_ register
your traffic with the Campaign Registry. Otherwise, the carriers will not
deliver your messages. Please see [**Campaign Registry - Everything You Need To Know**](/messaging/get-started/campaign-registry) for more information.

## Wrap up

We have shown how to receive a text message and perform follow-up actions.

This example used the [Compatibility API](/compatibility-api), and in
particular [cXML](compatibility-api/cxml/index.mdx) bins, to receive
a message. For more advanced, real-time applications, you'll want to check out
our [Realtime SDK](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk/relay-v4).
