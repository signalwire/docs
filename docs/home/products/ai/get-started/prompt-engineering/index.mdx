# Prompt engineering best practices

<Subtitle>Master the art of crafting effective prompts for SignalWire AI Agents</Subtitle>

## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting clear, effective instructions for AI models. In the context of SignalWire AI Agents, it serves as the foundation for achieving consistent, high-quality interactions that precisely match your requirements. Well-crafted prompts act as a bridge between human intent and AI execution, enabling you to harness the full potential of AI capabilities while maintaining precise control over the output.

The effectiveness of an AI interaction largely depends on how well you communicate your requirements. Just as a new employee needs clear direction to perform at their best, AI models require well-structured, unambiguous instructions to deliver optimal results. This guide will walk you through proven techniques and best practices that will help you master the art of prompt engineering.

## Core principles

### Clarity and directness

The foundation of effective prompt engineering lies in clarity and directness. AI models, despite their sophistication, interpret instructions literally and lack the human ability to infer unstated requirements or fill in gaps with common sense. Therefore, explicit and detailed instructions are crucial for achieving desired outcomes.

When crafting prompts, focus on eliminating ambiguity and providing comprehensive context. Your instructions should leave no room for interpretation, clearly stating not just what you want the AI to do, but also how you want it done and what the expected outcome should look like.

Here are key elements that contribute to clear and direct prompts:

1. **Be Specific**
   Your instructions should precisely define both the task and its boundaries. Consider these aspects:
   - State exactly what you want the AI to do
   - Define the scope and boundaries of the task
   - Specify the desired format for the output

2. **Provide Context**
   Context helps the AI understand the broader purpose and align its responses accordingly:
   - Explain the purpose of the task
   - Describe the intended audience
   - Include relevant background information

3. **Set Clear Parameters**
   Define success criteria and constraints to ensure the output meets your requirements:
   - Define success criteria
   - Specify any constraints or limitations
   - Include quality requirements

   Maintain uniform styling and organization throughout your prompts to ensure reliable, predictable responses.

## Advanced techniques

As you become more comfortable with basic prompt engineering, you can leverage advanced techniques to achieve more sophisticated and nuanced interactions. These techniques help you handle complex scenarios and achieve more precise control over the AI's responses.

### Multishot prompting

Multishot prompting, also known as example-based prompting, is a powerful technique where you provide multiple examples to guide the AI's behavior. By showing the AI several examples of desired input-output patterns, you create a clear template for it to follow.

Here's an example of multishot prompting:

```markdown
When responding to customer inquiries, follow these example patterns:

Input: "How do I reset my password?"
Response: 
1. Visit the login page
2. Click "Forgot Password"
3. Enter your email
4. Follow the reset link in your email
Note: Reset links expire in 24 hours.

Input: "Where can I find API documentation?"
Response:
1. Go to our documentation homepage
2. Navigate to "API Reference"
3. Select your preferred programming language
Note: Sample code is available for all major languages.
```

This technique is especially valuable when:
- Dealing with complex response formats
- Handling edge cases
- Ensuring consistency across multiple interactions
- Teaching the AI specific patterns or styles

### Chain of thought

Chain of Thought prompting encourages the AI to break down complex tasks into smaller, logical steps and show its reasoning process. This approach not only helps the AI arrive at better solutions but also makes its decision-making process transparent and verifiable.

Here's an example of Chain of Thought prompting:

```markdown
When analyzing technical issues, follow these steps:

1. Problem Statement
   - Clearly state the reported issue
   - List any error messages or symptoms
   - Note the context and environment

2. Information Gathering
   - Identify relevant system components
   - Check for recent changes
   - List affected functionalities

3. Analysis
   - Consider possible root causes
   - Evaluate impact and severity
   - Identify potential solutions

4. Solution
   - Choose the most appropriate fix
   - Explain the reasoning
   - List implementation steps
```

This technique helps:

- Show empathy and patience
- Follow security protocols

## Standard process
1. Acknowledge the customer's concern
2. Ask clarifying questions when needed
3. Provide step-by-step solutions
4. Confirm understanding
```

### Contexts and steps

Contexts allow you to create specialized behavior patterns for different scenarios. Each context:
- Maintains its own conversation memory
- Has specific objectives and guidelines
- Can contain multiple sequential steps
- Operates independently of other contexts

Here's an example of how you might structure a technical support context:

```markdown
# Technical support context

## Problem identification
First, gather essential information:
- Error messages or symptoms
- System configuration
- Recent changes or updates

1. Start with basic diagnostics
2. Progress to specific solutions
3. Document each step attempted
4. Verify resolution success
```

### Context switching

One of the powerful features of SignalWire AI Agents is their ability to switch contexts seamlessly. When a context switch occurs:
- Previous context memory is cleared
- New context's instructions take effect
- Global instructions remain active
- Conversation flow stays natural

This allows your AI Agent to:
- Handle different types of inquiries
- Maintain appropriate expertise per topic
- Keep conversations organized
- Provide specialized assistance as needed

### Memory management

Understanding how memory works across contexts is crucial for effective prompt design:

1. **Global Memory**
   - Persists throughout the conversation
   - Maintains overall user context
   - Preserves important user information
   - Guides general behavior

2. **Context Memory**
   - Specific to each context
   - Resets on context switches
   - Maintains focused conversation flow
   - Prevents context pollution

### Organizing prompts

Whether using Markdown or XML-style formatting, well-organized prompts help the AI process information effectively:

```markdown
# Section purpose
Clear description of the section's goal

## Guidelines
- Key points to follow
- Important rules
- Specific requirements

## Process steps
1. First action to take
2. Next steps to follow
3. Resolution requirements
```
