# Prompt engineering best practices

<Subtitle>Essential techniques for creating effective AI prompts</Subtitle>

Effective prompt engineering requires careful thought and attention to detail. The difference between a successful prompt and an ineffective one often comes down to structure, clarity, and precision. This guide explores proven techniques for creating prompts that consistently deliver reliable results.

## The foundation: Clarity and precision

AI models interpret instructions literally, making clarity and precision essential elements of effective prompts. Consider these instructions as a technical specification - every detail matters, and ambiguity can lead to unexpected results.

### Establishing clear parameters

When crafting prompts, precision and specificity are crucial. It is important to clearly define what you aim to achieve, set the boundaries and limitations of your project, specify the desired output formats, and outline the criteria for measuring success.

Here are examples demonstrating effective and ineffective approaches:

```markdown
Hey, we need help with our customer support. Just handle whatever questions come in and try to be helpful. Make sure customers are happy and don't say anything wrong.
```

## Support Agent Role
You're part of WonderTech's customer support team, handling our enterprise software inquiries.

## Response Framework
1. Issue Categories
   - Installation problems (check system compatibility first)
   - Account access (verify identity before proceeding)
   - Feature requests (log for product team)
   - Billing questions (route to billing team if complex)

2. Response Structure
   - Start with a warm greeting
   - Acknowledge the specific issue
   - Provide step-by-step solutions
   - End with a clear next action

3. Key Policies
   - 48-hour response guarantee
   - Full refund within 30 days
   - Premium support for enterprise clients

## Communication Guidelines
- Use clear, jargon-free language
- Include relevant documentation links
- Escalate critical issues to supervisors
- Follow up within 24 hours

### Critical context elements

The effectiveness of a prompt is shaped by several factors, including its overall purpose and end goals, the characteristics of the target audience, the necessary background information, and the requirements of the interaction medium.

### Defining boundaries

Successful prompts require clear parameters that define measurable criteria for success, establish specific operational constraints, set any response length requirements, and prioritize key information.

## Leveraging common knowledge

Think about asking someone to hang a picture in your home. You wouldn't need to explain how to use a hammer or what a nail is - that's common knowledge. However, you would need to specify where you want the picture hung, which frame to use, and how high to place it. These specific details are crucial for achieving the desired outcome.

This same principle applies when working with AI. Like a capable assistant, AI systems come with a foundation of general knowledge. The key is understanding what information you need to provide versus what the AI already knows.

### Understanding the balance

When someone asks "Can you hang this picture?", they assume the person understands how to use basic tools, which ones are needed, basic safety precautions, and standard hanging techniques. However, it remains essential to specify where exactly the picture should be hung, the desired height and layout, the frame to be used, and any special mounting instructions.

Similarly, when prompting an AI, you don't need to explain:
- Basic grammar and formatting
- Common professional conventions
- Standard writing structures
- General knowledge concepts

Instead, focus on providing:
- Specific requirements for your use case
- Unique constraints or parameters
- Domain-specific context
- Special formatting needs

  * Date of birth
  * Phone number
- Handle with extra care and politeness
- Confirm details clearly with patient

## Emergency protocol
- Listen carefully for mentions of tooth pain
- Understand this requires urgent attention
- Prioritize scheduling within 24 hours
- Show empathy and concern

## Special instructions
- Direct insurance inquiries politely to extension 2
- Explain doctor specialties clearly:
  * Dr. Smith: Cosmetic dentistry
  * Dr. Chen: Pediatrics
- Inform professionally about 90-minute new patient appointments
- Always end by asking if they need anything else
```

## Structural best practices

Structuring and formatting prompts clearly is key for effective communication. Rather than relying solely on bullet points, consider that a well-structured prompt is composed of several components: a clearly defined role, a comprehensive knowledge base, clear response guidelines, a precise task definition, and any necessary constraints. This integrated approach helps ensure that both humans and AI understand the intended context and desired outcomes.

To best accomplish separating our prompt into sections, we can utilize [Markdown][markdown-guide] or [XML][xml-guide] formatting.
This structure helps the AI understand relationships between concepts and prioritize information appropriately.

## Iterative refinement process

Prompt development benefits from systematic refinement. Begin by establishing essential requirements by defining the core functionality, identifying critical components, and setting a clear baseline for success. Next, focus on testing and optimization by evaluating the prompt in various scenarios, carefully documenting response patterns, and addressing any emerging edge cases. Finally, implement quality control by resolving any contradictions, maintaining thorough version control, and continuously tracking the effectiveness of your prompt.



<Admonition type="warning">
Avoid over-optimization. Complex prompts can impede natural interaction or cause hallucinations. Sometimes a simple prompt is more effective.
