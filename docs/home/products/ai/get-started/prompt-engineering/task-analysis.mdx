# Analysis Tasks in Prompt Engineering

<Subtitle>Master techniques for creating prompts that effectively analyze data and generate insights</Subtitle>

## Overview

Analysis tasks require the AI to process and derive insights from structured data such as API responses, call logs, or communication metrics. In the context of SignalWire AI Agents, these tasks often involve analyzing communication patterns, user interactions, and system performance data to generate actionable insights.

This guide provides best practices for crafting prompts that enable effective data analysis in real-time conversational AI contexts.

## Structured Workflow for Analysis Prompts

For effective analysis tasks, follow a structured workflow in your prompts that guides the AI through a systematic approach to data processing.

### 1. Data Collection

Begin by establishing how the AI should gather and validate the information it needs to perform its analysis:

```markdown
# Data Collection Instructions

## Required Information
- Collect the user's account ID before proceeding with any call log analysis
- Verify the time period for analysis (default to last 7 days if not specified)
- Confirm which metrics are most important to the user (cost, duration, quality, etc.)

## Validation Steps
- Ensure account ID format is valid (alphanumeric, 10 characters)
- Check that the requested time period has available data
- Verify user has permissions to access the requested metrics
```

#### Do
- Specify exactly what data points are necessary before analysis can begin
- Include validation steps to ensure data quality
- Provide default values or fallbacks when information is missing

#### Don't
- Assume data completeness or quality
- Skip validation steps for critical information
- Begin analysis with incomplete information

### 2. Analysis Framework

Provide a clear framework for how the AI should approach the analysis to ensure consistency and reliability:

```markdown
# Call Volume Analysis Framework

## Primary Metrics
- Total call count
- Average call duration
- Peak call times
- Call failure rate

## Comparison Points
- Compare to previous period (same duration)
- Benchmark against industry average
- Evaluate against user's defined goals

## Statistical Approach
- Identify outliers (Â±2 standard deviations)
- Calculate growth/decline as percentage
- Determine statistical significance for changes >5%
```

#### Do
- Define specific metrics and what they mean in your context
- Establish clear comparison points
- Specify the level of detail expected in the analysis

#### Don't
- Leave the analytical approach undefined
- Use ambiguous metrics or terminology
- Forget to include context for what makes results significant

### 3. Insight Generation

Guide the AI in transforming raw analysis into actionable insights with clear value to the user:

```markdown
# Insight Formation Guidelines

## Pattern Identification
- Group related metrics to identify causal relationships
- Look for periodic patterns (daily, weekly, monthly cycles)
- Flag any sudden changes or anomalies

## Business Impact Assessment
- Connect metrics to cost implications
- Identify quality of service impacts
- Relate findings to customer experience

## Recommendation Structure
- Start with highest impact observation
- Provide 2-3 specific, actionable recommendations
- Include expected outcomes of following recommendations
- Suggest timeline for implementation and measurement
```

#### Do
- Direct the AI to move beyond raw numbers to meaningful insights
- Connect technical findings to business outcomes
- Format recommendations in an actionable way

#### Don't
- Allow the AI to simply recite statistics without interpretation
- Omit actionable recommendations
- Forget to prioritize insights by importance

## Best Practices for Analysis Tasks

When creating prompts for analysis tasks with SignalWire AI Agents, consider these best practices:

### Data Preparation Guidelines

```markdown
# Data Preparation Instructions

When analyzing call quality metrics:

## Standardization Requirements
- Convert all timestamps to user's local timezone
- Normalize duration values to seconds
- Use consistent decimal precision (2 decimal places)

## Data Cleaning Protocol
- Identify and flag potential outliers
- Handle missing values by [specific method]
- Remove test calls identifiable by [criteria]

## Context Enhancement
- Enrich raw data with account tier information
- Correlate with relevant external factors (known outages, holidays)
- Tag calls with appropriate categories based on purpose
```

### Analysis Process Instructions

```markdown
# Analysis Methodology

When analyzing customer interaction patterns:

## Sequential Steps
1. First segment calls by type (sales, support, technical)
2. Then analyze duration distributions within each segment
3. Next identify common topics using transcription data
4. Finally correlate topics with satisfaction scores

## Confidence Evaluation
- Report high confidence findings separately from speculative insights
- Include sample size with all statistical claims
- Specify margin of error for predictions

## Contextual Considerations
- Account for seasonal factors affecting patterns
- Consider business hours vs. after-hours differences
- Acknowledge limitations of the available dataset
```

### Output Generation Format

```markdown
# Analysis Output Format

Structure your analysis using the following format:

## Executive Summary
- 2-3 sentence overview of most significant findings
- Highlight the single most actionable insight
- Specify severity/urgency level

## Detailed Findings
- Present key metrics in descending order of importance
- Use comparative statements (increased/decreased by X%)
- Support each finding with specific data points

## Visual Descriptions
- Describe trends as if explaining a graph or chart
- Use clear comparative language for distributions
- Provide numeric anchors for context (e.g., "double the industry average")

## Recommendations
- List specific, actionable steps
- Prioritize by impact and implementation difficulty
- Include expected outcomes and measurement criteria
```

## Examples of Effective Analysis Prompts

### Example 1: Call Quality Analysis

```markdown
# Call Quality Analysis Agent

You will analyze call quality metrics for customer service calls and identify improvement opportunities.

## Data Requirements
- Call logs from the past 30 days
- MOS (Mean Opinion Score) metrics
- Jitter, latency, and packet loss measurements
- Geographic distribution of calls

## Analysis Approach
1. Calculate average quality metrics by region and network type
2. Identify times of day with quality degradation
3. Correlate quality issues with specific network providers
4. Compare mobile vs. landline connection quality

## Insight Delivery Format
- Begin with overall health assessment (Good/Concerning/Critical)
- Identify top 3 factors affecting call quality
- Provide specific threshold recommendations for routing decisions
- Suggest 2-3 technical optimizations with projected impact

DO: Focus on actionable infrastructure changes rather than user behavior
DON'T: Make recommendations that would increase cost without quantifying benefits
```

### Example 2: Customer Engagement Analysis

```markdown
# Customer Engagement Analyzer

You will analyze customer engagement patterns in video conferencing sessions to improve participant experience.

## Data Collection Requirements
- Session duration metrics
- Participant count and join/leave patterns
- Feature usage statistics (screen sharing, chat, reactions)
- Post-call satisfaction ratings

## Analysis Framework
1. Calculate engagement scores based on active participation markers
2. Identify features correlated with higher satisfaction
3. Determine optimal session length by meeting type
4. Analyze factors leading to early participant departure

## Insights to Generate
- Identify meeting structures that maintain highest engagement
- Recommend feature introduction timing for optimal adoption
- Suggest participant count thresholds by meeting type
- Provide facilitation recommendations based on participation patterns

## Output Format
- Present as "Top 5 Engagement Insights" in descending impact order
- Format recommendations as specific, actionable bullet points
- Include "Quick Win" section for immediately implementable changes
- Add "Further Investigation Needed" section for areas with incomplete data

DO: Connect engagement patterns to business outcomes
DON'T: Make assumptions about user intent without supporting data
```

<Admonition type="tip">
For voice and video applications, analysis prompts should include instructions on how to present complex data audibly in a conversational manner. Specify prioritization of information and conversational transitions between data points.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- **Define analysis goals clearly**: "Identify call patterns that indicate potential customer churn risk"
- **Specify data parameters**: "Focus analysis on calls longer than 5 minutes with negative sentiment markers"
- **Structure output format**: "Present findings as a prioritized list with confidence levels"
- **Include example insights**: "Example insight: '27% increase in support calls following recent UI update'"
- **Set contextual boundaries**: "Limit analysis to enterprise-tier customers with >6 months history"

### Don't

- **Use vague directives**: "Analyze the call data and tell me what you find"
- **Skip validation requirements**: "Use whatever data is available to form conclusions"
- **Omit prioritization guidance**: "List all patterns you can identify from the data"
- **Neglect actionability**: "Focus on statistical anomalies without business context"
- **Ignore confidence levels**: "Present all findings as equally valid regardless of sample size"
