# Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

<Subtitle>Master sophisticated techniques for greater control and effectiveness with SignalWire AI Agents</Subtitle>

## Overview

As you become more comfortable with basic prompt engineering, you can leverage advanced techniques to achieve more sophisticated and nuanced interactions. These techniques help you handle complex scenarios and achieve more precise control over the AI's responses, particularly important for real-time voice and video interactions.

## Available Guides

This section covers several advanced techniques that can significantly enhance your prompt engineering capabilities:

## When to Use Advanced Techniques

While basic prompt engineering is sufficient for many use cases, consider using advanced techniques when:

1. **You need more precise control** over the AI's responses
2. **Consistency across similar requests** is critical
3. **Complex reasoning or analysis** is required
4. **Long, multi-turn conversations** are expected
5. **High-stakes interactions** demand reliable outputs

<Admonition type="tip">
Start with mastering the basics before diving into advanced techniques. A well-crafted basic prompt often outperforms a poorly implemented advanced technique.

## Combining Techniques

The most effective prompt engineering often involves combining multiple techniques. For example:

- Use **multishot prompting** with **chain of thought** to demonstrate both the desired output and the reasoning process
- Apply the **RISEN framework** while optimizing for **long context windows** in extended customer service interactions
- Integrate **chain of thought** with core principles like progressive refinement for complex troubleshooting scenarios

Each technique in this section builds upon the core principles and can be adapted to your specific use case and the capabilities of SignalWire AI Agents.

## Next Steps

Explore each technique in detail through the dedicated guides, and experiment with implementing them in your SignalWire AI Agent prompts. Return to this page as a central reference for advanced prompt engineering techniques.
