## Core capabilities

### Voice technology

SignalWire's voice technology gives you control over how your AI agents sound and understand speech:

- Choose from multiple Text-to-Speech providers and fine-tune voice parameters to match your brand
- Add natural speech <Tooltips tip="A user can define what words or phrases to say during pauses in the conversation. These pauses can occur from function calls or speech down time.">fillers</Tooltips> to maintain conversation flow during processing pauses
- Process incoming audio in real-time with noise filtering and accent handling

### Conversation intelligence

SignalWire AI helps you build agents that can handle complex conversations naturally. Unlike traditional IVR systems that follow rigid decision trees, your agents can:

- Stay on task and maintain their assigned role
- Keep track of multiple conversation threads
- Interface with multiple backend systems while maintaining natural dialogue
- Handle unexpected topic changes without losing context

Let's compare how a customer might schedule a medical appointment:


<PreviewCardGroup columns={2}>
  <PreviewCard title="Traditional IVR Flow" description="A detailed diagram of a traditional IVR system.">
    <TraditionalIVRFlow />
  </PreviewCard>
  <PreviewCard title="AI IVR Flow" description="A detailed diagram of an AI-powered IVR system.">
    <AIVRFlow />
  </PreviewCard>
</PreviewCardGroup>


For example, when a caller asks "What about the premium version?", the AI understands this refers to a product discussed
earlier in the conversation. This context awareness extends across different topics and requests within the same interaction, allowing for natural conversation
flows like:

"I'd like to schedule an appointment" → "What time works for you?" → "Actually, before we do that, what's your cancellation policy?"

The AI handles these context switches seamlessly while maintaining the original intent to schedule an appointment.

### Dynamic context switching

One powerful way to structure conversations is through "contexts" - specialized mini-agents with their own skills, prompts, permissions, and access to tools. Instead of transferring callers between departments like a traditional system, your AI agent switches contexts internally to handle different parts of the conversation.

Each context has:
- Specific prompts and instructions
- Defined permissions and access levels
- Specialized tools and integrations
- Its own conversation memory

This approach lets you:
- Route each task to the most appropriate specialized context
- Control what information passes between contexts
- Maintain natural conversation flow while switching roles
- Implement security boundaries for sensitive operations

Let's compare how a complex support interaction works:


<PreviewCardGroup columns={2}>
<PreviewCard title="Traditional Support Flow" description="This diagram showcases what a support call looks like in a traditional IVR system.">
  <TraditionalSupportFlow />
</PreviewCard>
<PreviewCard title="AI Support Flow" description="This diagram showcases what a support call looks like in an AI-powered IVR system.">
  <AISupportFlow />
</PreviewCard>
</PreviewCardGroup>


Each context operates independently with:
- Its own specialized prompt
- Fresh conversation memory
- Focused expertise (technical, billing, sales)
- Strict information boundaries

This approach ensures:
- Specialized knowledge stays within appropriate contexts
- No information bleeds between different roles
- Clear compliance and security boundaries
- Purpose-built responses for each domain

For example, when a customer moves from technical support to billing questions, the AI creates a fresh agent focused solely on financial matters, leaving technical details in the previous context. This isolation maintains security while ensuring each interaction benefits from specialized expertise.

### Real-time analytics and monitoring

Use comprehensive analytics to understand and optimize how your AI agents perform. The platform captures data about:

- Conversation flow and role adherence
- Speech recognition accuracy
- Response timing and latency
- Voice quality metrics
- Integration performance

This data flows through a robust webhook system that lets you:

- Monitor conversations in real-time
- Track key performance metrics
- Enable human supervision when needed
- Optimize agent behavior

Here's how this works in a customer support scenario:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Customer
    participant A as AI Agent
    participant W as Webhook

    C->>A: Asks about product return
    Note over A: Processes request
    A->>W: Sends interaction data
    Note over W: Analytics Processing
    A->>C: Responds to customer
    Note over W: Real-time updates:<br/>- Speech confidence: 0.876<br/>- Response time: 850ms<br/>- Language: en-US
```

#### Webhook data and metrics

Here's an example of the data you receive during an AI interaction:

```json
{
  "call_info": {
    "project_id": "b08dacad...",
    "content_type": "text/json",
    "call_id": "b3f4e4e1..."
  },
  "conversation_add": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "...",
    "lang": "en-US",
    "tokens": 53,
    "latency": 836,
    "utterance_latency": 934,
    "audio_latency": 1106
  },
  "webhook_reply": {
    "status": "OK",
    "request_id": "341de258...",
    "parameters": {
      "query": "...",
    },
    "data": {...}
  }
}
```


#### Management tools

The real-time data enables you to:

- **Monitor Live Conversations:** 
  - Watch high-value interactions in real-time
  - Get alerts for critical situations
  - Step in when human help is needed

- **Improve Performance:** 
  - Adjust AI behavior based on metrics
  - Update routing rules
  - Fine-tune response patterns

- **Ensure Quality:**
  - Catch and fix issues quickly
  - Meet compliance requirements
  - Track service quality

The webhook system uses standard JSON formats and includes retry mechanisms for reliable delivery to your analytics tools.

## Integration & architecture

### External service integration

SignalWire AI connects with your business systems through its function framework. When your agent needs to perform an action - like checking inventory or booking an appointment - it can call functions that interact with your databases and services while keeping the conversation natural.

Here's an example of scheduling a meeting:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
            autonumber
            
            participant Customer
            participant AI
            participant Functions
            participant CalAPI as Calendar API
            participant SMS

            %% Initial Request
            Customer->>+AI: I need to schedule a meeting with the sales team
            Note right of AI: Detects scheduling intent
            AI-->>AI: Identifies scheduling need
            AI->>-Customer: I can help. When is best for you next week?
            
            %% Time Selection
            Customer->>+AI: Tuesday afternoon would be great
            
            %% Availability Check
            Note over AI,CalAPI: Checking team availability
            AI->>+Functions: check_team_availability()
            Functions->>+CalAPI: Query sales team calendar
            CalAPI-->>-Functions: Return available slots
            Functions-->>-AI: Provide available times
            
            AI->>-Customer: The sales team is free at 2 PM or 4 PM on Tuesday
            Customer->>+AI: 2 PM works perfectly
            
            %% Meeting Setup
            Note over AI,CalAPI: Scheduling the meeting
            AI->>+Functions: schedule_meeting()
            Functions->>+CalAPI: Create event and send invites
            CalAPI-->>-Functions: Confirm booking and invites sent
            
            %% Notifications
            Note over Functions,SMS: Sending notifications
            Functions->>Functions: Trigger SMS notification
            Functions->>+SMS: Send confirmation text
            SMS-->>-Functions: Confirm delivery status
            
            Functions-->>-AI: Confirm meeting setup
            AI->>-Customer: Meeting scheduled for Tuesday at 2 PM
            Note over Customer,AI: You'll receive a calendar invite and a confirmation SMS
```

The process works like this:

1. Your agent recognizes when a request needs external data or actions
2. It calls the appropriate function
3. The function handles the technical work with your systems
4. Your agent incorporates the results naturally into the conversation

This lets you automate complex processes without exposing the technical details to your users.
