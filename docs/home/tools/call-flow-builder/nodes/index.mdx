# Nodes

<Subtitle>Call Flow Builder</Subtitle>

## Introduction

A call flow consists of a series of nodes, which represent different actions that can be taken during a call. 
Each node has a specific purpose, and you can connect nodes together to create a complete calling application.

### Starting node

Starting nodes are the first nodes in a call flow and are used to handle incoming calls.

| Node                                    | Description                                               |
