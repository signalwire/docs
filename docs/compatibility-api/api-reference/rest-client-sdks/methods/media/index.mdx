# Media

The **Media** object represents a single attachment or media file that is associated with a [Message](../messaging/index.mdx).

To simplify sharing of the media files with external applications, the URLs to the files themselves are made publicly accessible. These URLs are random, long and hard to guess, so the contents of the media should stay private unless you choose to distribute the URL. This means that these URLS can be included in any web application to access the files without needing your credentials.

A media object is created when an incoming message is received, or an outgoing message is created, that contain one or more attachments.
