title: <Pay>
slug: /compatibility-api/cxml/voice/pay
---



## Overview

The `<Pay>` verb enables secure payment processing during voice calls. When implemented in your voice application,
it handles the complete payment flow including data collection, validation, and processing through your configured payment gateway.

The `<Pay>` verb also has two nouns that are embedded within it:
- [`<Parameter>`](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/pay/parameter): Pass custom parameters to your payment processor.
- [`<Prompt>`](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/pay/prompt): Customize the prompts used during payment collection.

## Core Functionality

- Secure payment information collection
- Real-time payment processing
- Payment method tokenization
- Multi-currency support
- Automated retry handling
- Status tracking via webhooks

---

## Transaction Types

The `<Pay>` verb supports two primary transaction types: immediate charges and tokenization.

### Immediate Charges
When you need to process a payment right away, use an immediate charge transaction. This collects the payment details and processes the transaction in one step.

To execute an immediate charge:
```xml
<Pay chargeAmount="25.00"/>
```
Setting any positive value for `chargeAmount` initiates an immediate charge transaction.

### Tokenization
Tokenization allows you to securely store payment information for future use. Instead of processing a payment, it generates a secure token that represents the payment method. This is particularly useful for:
- Subscription services
- Recurring billing
- One-click checkout experiences

To tokenize payment information:
```xml
<Pay chargeAmount="0"/>
```

You can also omit the `chargeAmount` attribute entirely:

:::note
The actual token is provided & stored by your payment processor, which can be used for future transactions without requiring customers
to re-enter their payment details. This may differ depending on the payment processor you are using.
