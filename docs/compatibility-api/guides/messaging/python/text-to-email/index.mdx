This guide will show you how you can handle incoming text messages and forward them to an email address.  
We will do that by building a server that receives network requests from SignalWire whenever an SMS is received, and then sends an email.

What do I need to run this code?
--------------------------------

You can find the full code for this application on GitHub [here](https://github.com/signalwire/snippets-text-to-email). To run it, you will need the [MailGun API](https://www.mailgun.com/) to send an email.

You will also need a SignalWire phone number which is configured for webhooks. Within the **Phone Numbers** tab of your SignalWire portal you will be able to acquire a phone number: you should configure its "Messaging Settings" to handle messages using a "LaML Webhook". Then, you need to specify the _public URL_ where your application is listening to. You can use ngrok to get a public address, see our guide on [How to Locally Test Webhooks with Ngrok](/platform/basics/guides/technical-troubleshooting/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok). Regardless of what your public address will be, this application listens for POST requests on the `/sms-webhook` route, so your URL will be something like `https://<yourdomain>/sms-webhook`.

How to Run the Application
--------------------------

### Build and Run on Docker

You can either:

**Use our pre-built image from Docker Hub:**

```
docker pull signalwire/snippets-text-to-email:python
```

or, **build your own Docker image:**

1. Build your image

```
docker build -t snippets-text-to-email .
```

2. Run your image

```
docker run --publish 5000:5000 --env-file .env snippets-text-to-email
```

3. The application will run on port 5000

### Build and Run Natively

To run the application, execute `export FLASK_APP=app.py` then run `flask run`.

You may need to use an SSH tunnel for testing this code if running on your local machine. â€“ we recommend [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). You can learn more about how to use ngrok [here](/platform/basics/guides/technical-troubleshooting/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok). 

Step by Step Code Walkthrough
-----------------------------

Within the Github repository you will find several files, but we're interested in:

- Python/app.py 
- Python/example.env

The first one (app.py) contains the full implementation of the application. The second one contains some environment variables for configuration.

### Setup Your Environment File

1. Copy from example.env and fill in your values.
2. Save a new file called .env

Your file should look something like this.

```
# MailGun domain associated with your MailGun account
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=
# MailGun token associated with your MailGun Account
MAILGUN_API_TOKEN=
# Send Email From Address
EMAIL_FROM=info@yourdomain.com
# Send email to address for administrator notifications
EMAIL_TO=youremail@yourdomain.com
# Email subject for admin notifications
EMAIL_SUBJECT=Forward Text To Email
```

### The application

This code is actually very simple - you need only one route and one function! The first step is to define a function `send_email(body)` that will utilize the MailGun API to send an email using the variables from our `.env` file.

```python
# Send email with MailGun
def send_email(body):
    return requests.post(
        "https://api.mailgun.net/v3/" + os.environ['MAILGUN_DOMAIN'] + "/messages",
        auth=("api", os.environ['MAILGUN_API_TOKEN']),
        data={"from": os.environ['EMAIL_FROM'],
              "to": [os.environ['EMAIL_TO']],
              "subject": os.environ['EMAIL_SUBJECT'],
              "text": body })
```

Our only route `/sms-webhook` will listen for POST requests from incoming messages and will use the JSON form data as the body of the email. 

```python
# Listen on route '/sms-webhook' for GET/POST requests
@app.route('/sms-webhook', methods=['POST'])
def sms_webhook():
    # Forward incoming form data to email
    send_email(pprint.pformat(request.form, indent=4))
    return "200"
```

Wrap Up
-------

When dealing with SMSes in large scale, you'll often want to convert them into a more manageable format. This guide has shown one possible way to achieve that goal by converting them to emails, using a remarkably short script of code.
