# Creating and Using cXML Applications

### What Are cXML Applications?

cXML applications create a URL endpoint that responds with a set of instructions that can be executed to handle calls, SMS, or fax. 

cXML applications are powerful tools that rely on simple logic. 
Commands such as `<Gather>` can handle call or message flows within the `action` parameter, but complex logic such as "Press 1 for sales, 2 for support, etc" will require using one of our SDKs and hosting the code on a server instead of using bins. 
[Gathering Keypad Input](/voice/getting-started/how-to-gather-keypad-input-from-user) is a good example of `<Gather>`, using simple logic LaML Bins can handle, and what type of logic that would require hosting your own code.

#### What is the difference between Webhooks and cXML Applications?

Webhooks pass requests to a web application that is hosted from a server or SSH tunnel.

By contrast, cXML applications are effectively serverless. 
When a cXML application is given a request it responds directly with XML/LaML commands. 
You can read more about SignalWire Webhooks in our [Webhooks Overview](/platform/phone-numbers/guides/how-to-configure-your-webhook). 

### What do I need?

All you will need is a SignalWire account, which you can sign up for [here](https://signalwire.com/signup). 
Signing in with your SignalWire username and password will bring you to the Dashboard.


:::info Additional Information

While bins can be created and updated [programmatically](/docs/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/fabric/cxml-applications-list),
this guide will walk you through cXML applications via the SignalWire Dashboard.
For more on the Dashboard, see our guide to [Navigating Your SignalWire Space](/platform/dashboard/get-started/explore).

:::

### Navigating the SignalWire Dashboard

#### From the Dashboard:

Once you are logged in, on the left-hand side of your Dashboard should be several tabs. 
For the purposes of this guide, find and select the "LƒÅML" tab.

  <img className="img-800" src={require("./bb61154-project_side_menu.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the menu pane of a SignalWire Space showing the LaML tab. " />
</figure>

#### LaML Logs

Navigating to this tab will open a panel that contains logs for you for items such as `Voice`, `Messaging`, etc. 
Here you will also notice the `Bins` tab which is what we are looking for.

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./41e3320-SWBins.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the LaML tab, with the 'Bins' tab circled in red." />
</figure>

#### The Bins Tab

Once we have navigated to the `Bins` tab, we will see a list of the bins we have created.
Each bin is listed with its request URL, the amount of requests received, and the last time a request was made to a bin. 
In the top right we will see a `+ New` button which will allow us to create a new bin.

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./067af2d-NewBin.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the 'Bins' tab with the blue 'New' button circled in red." />
</figure>

#### New Bin

Here we can name our bins, and provide a set of instructions to be executed when the bin is requested. 
In this case, our `Response` to an incoming call would use text-to-speech to say "Hello, Welcome to SignalWire!". 

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./363f15d-SWBinSave.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the new bin. There are input fields for the Bin Name as well as the content of the LaML code." />
</figure>

#### Saving a Bin

Once we have inserted our LaML instructions, we can `Save` the bin, and we will be redirected to the previous page.

Now our newly created bin will be listed with the information discussed previously. 
The most important column for us is the `Request URL`, which is the URL of the endpoint for that bin. 
This endpoint will allow us to point our SignalWire phone number to a bin. 
Click the icon next to this URL to copy it to your clipboard.

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./2b10195-Screenshot_1.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the created bin. The newly created bin is visible. The request URL appears next to a copy icon, which is circled in red." />
</figure>

#### Using our New Bin

Now that we have created a bin, we need a phone number that will point to our bin. 
If you need to purchase a phone number, we have an awesome guide to 
[Buying a Phone Number](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number). 

Once you have done that, we can navigate back to our `Phone Numbers` tab in the Dashboard.

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./5772bfb-ClickNumber.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the Phone Numbers tab in the SignalWire Space. The Purchased tab is selected. A phone number is circled in red." />
</figure>

Here we will find a list of phone numbers we own, as well as our `Verified` numbers and a few other tabs.  
Each phone number listed will have the following attributes:

- `Name`: A `friendlyname` attribute that can be changed to help keep track of your numbers.
- `Number`: The actual phone number.
- `Capabilities`: The abilities assigned to the number. By default, most numbers are capable of Calling, SMS, MMS, and Fax.

Clicking on the 'Name' of the phone number will allow us to view more information about the number.

Here we can view the `Type` of phone number, the `ID`, `Throughput`, and the `Next Billed On` date.

Our goal is to point this phone number to the cXML application we have created, and do to that we will navigate to `Edit Settings`.

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./a0e2d2f-Settings.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the details page for the selected phone number. The 'Edit Settings' button is circled in red." />
</figure>

Once we are here we can set a 'friendly name' for our number.

Under `Voice and Fax` settings, we can set `Accept Incoming Calls As` to `Voice Calls`.

Next we can set our `Handle Calls` as LaML webhooks.

Finally, we can paste the endpoint URL of our bin into the `When Calls Come In` text box.

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./3cb24b1-InsertURL.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the Number Settings page. Under the Voice and Fax Settings header, the 'When a Call Comes in' field is circled in red. The LaML bin URL has been pasted in this field." />
</figure>

If your phone number handles SMS instead of calls, simply scroll down and follow the same steps in the `Message Settings` category.

<figure>
  <img className="img-800" src={require("./b1d4f0b-MessageSettings.webP").default} alt="A screenshot of the Message Settings category. 'Handle Messages Using' is set to LaML Webhooks, and the LaML bin URL is pasted in the 'When a Message Comes In' field." />
</figure>


:::caution

The cXML application we created provides a `<Say>` response that will not work with SMS. 
In this case the LaML bin will simply take the inbound SMS, and mark it as processed.

### Wrap Up

This guide has hopefully offered a step-by-step walkthrough for you to create and use your first cXML application! 
While cXML applications are not as feature-rich as a hosted web application can be, they are a great starting point and provide powerful server-less implementations for basic call, SMS, and fax handling.

### Resources
