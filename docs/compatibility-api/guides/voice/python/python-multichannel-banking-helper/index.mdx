This application will allow customers to check balance as well as obtain the due date for credit card payments via both voice and SMS.

What do I need to run this code?
--------------------------------

View the full code on our Github [here](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-guides/tree/master/code/python_multichannel_ivr)!

This guide uses the Python SignalWire SDK, for a guide on installation click [here](/compatibility-api/sdks).

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/#install-flask) will be needed to handle the web framework.

You will need a SignalWire phone number as well as your API Credentials (API Token, Space URL, and Project ID) which can all be found in an easily copyable format within the API tab of your SignalWire portal.

How to Run Application
----------------------

### Python Multichannel Banking Helper

To install prerequisites, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Using a virtualenv is recommended.

To run the application, execute `export FLASK_APP=app.py` then run `flask run`.

#### Connecting to your development application

To test the application with SignalWire while running locally, we recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

The application runs on port `5000` by default.

You can then set up your SignalWire DID to point at `your-ngrok-domain/voice` for voice calls and `your-ngrok-domain/sms` for messaging.
