# Queues

If you've ever called any company's support or sales line, you have probably
used a queue. Queueing is a crucial part of an IVR for any company to handle
multiple callers at once. SignalWire makes it easy to store callers in a queue
in the order that they called and then connect them to a live agent whenever
it's their turn. This guide will show you how to implement queues using XML
bins.

## Queues with cXML

We are going to define the instructions for forwarding instructions in an XML bin hosted on
SignalWire. To create a new cXML bin, navigate to the "Resources" section from your sidebar. There, create
a new script, and select the "cXML" option. 

You will need to create three separate scripts, whose content is given below.

First, to create a simple queue you need to use the
[`<Enqueue>`](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/enqueue) verb, which will
place the incoming caller into a queue. You can create an XML bin with the
following code and attach its URL to a phone number as the webhook for handling
inbound calls. Refer to [Making and Receiving Phone Calls](/voice/getting-started/making-and-receiving-phone-calls#receiving-incoming-calls)
for more information about connecting a bin to a phone number.

```xml title="Enqueuing bin"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Say>
    Thank you for calling Best Quality Vacuum. 
    Ed Galbraith is currently unavailable or speaking with other customers. 
    Please stay on the line to speak with one of his representatives.
  </Say>
  <Enqueue>Best Quality Vacuum</Enqueue>
</Response>
```

Then, we need a second bin which will allow an operator to dequeue calls. You
can configure a secondary phone number to handle incoming calls using the
following XML bin, so that operators can dial that phone number to start
speaking with customers.

```xml title="Dequeuing bin"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Say>Connecting to caller... The next voice you hear will be the customer.</Say>
  <Dial>
    <Queue url="https://example.signalwire.com/laml-bins/962230ad-10f5-485d-9bfa-458c7ae1213c">Best Quality Vacuum</Queue>
  </Dial>
</Response>
```

In this case, we used the
[`<Queue>`](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/queue-noun) noun to
determine the destination to dial. Note that the name of the queue corresponds
to the one used for the enqueqing bin: "Best Quality Vacuum". The `url`
attribute points to a third XML bin, which contains instructions on how to
handle each call in the queue as the caller is connected to the agent. In this
case, we are going to play a short message:

```xml title="User call bin"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Say>
    This call will be recorded for quality control and training. You will now
    be connected to the next representative.
  </Say>
</Response>
```

That's it. Make sure to [configure your two phone numbers](/voice/getting-started/making-and-receiving-phone-calls#receiving-incoming-calls)
to handle calls with respectively the enqueuing and dequeuing bin, and you will
be able to test it.

In this example we didn't actually start the recording of the call: to implement
it, check out our guide about [recording calls](/voice/getting-started/recording-calls).

## Conclusion

XML bins offer a quick and easy way to get started with common use cases. If you are an advanced developer, or you need more
flexibility and real-time control on your calls, you may be interested in our
