# Handling Calls from Code

In [Making and Receiving Phone Calls](/voice/getting-started/making-and-receiving-phone-calls) 
we learned how to use Compatibility XML bins to control outbound and inbound calls. 
In particular, we showed how to play a simple audio message.

Handling calls from code gives us more flexibility. 
Instead of serving a static XML bin, we can use a custom web server to decide the content of the XML
depending on the state of the call, on the caller, on the time, etc.

In this guide, we will show how to create a simple phone service which will tell the user the current day, with a variation on weekends.

## Setting up the environment

We are going to use a few libraries to make our job easier. In particular, we'll
need the SignalWire Compatibility SDK and, depending on the language you're
using, we'll also need a web server. Let's install them:

<Tabs groupId="compatibility-api">

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```shell
pip install flask signalwire
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```shell
composer require signalwire-community/signalwire
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```shell
npm install express @signalwire/compatibility-api
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Producing XML

We'd like to set up an endpoint (our own "dynamic" XML bin) which emits an XML document, like this one:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <Say>Welcome! Today is Friday.</Say>
</Response>
```

The XML will be sent back to the client as a response to their request.

In principle, we could manually create such XML by means of string concatenation
or interpolation. However, if you are using one of our supported languages, you
can use our libraries to more easily produce the same XML:

<Tabs groupId="compatibility-api">

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from twilio.twiml.voice_response import VoiceResponse

response = VoiceResponse()
response.say('Welcome! Today is Friday.')

# Prints the XML string.
print(response.to_xml())
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```php
<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
use \SignalWire\LaML\VoiceResponse;

$response = new VoiceResponse;
$response->say('Welcome! Today is Friday.');

# Prints the XML string.
echo $response->asXML();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
import { RestClient } from "@signalwire/compatibility-api";

const response = new RestClient.LaML.VoiceResponse();
response.say("Welcome! Today is Friday.");

// Prints the XML string.
console.log(response.toString());
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Serving the XML

Now that we know how to generate a proper Compatibility XML document, let's see
how to set up a web server to serve those documents.

### Setting up a web server

How you set up the web server is mostly specific to the language and framework
of your choosing. A basic skeleton might be the following:

<Tabs groupId="compatibility-api">

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python title="main.py"
from flask import Flask, request, Response
from twilio.twiml.voice_response import VoiceResponse

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def call_handler():
    """
    This endpoint will be queried by SignalWire whenever an incoming call is received.
    We respond with an XML document which specifies the next instructions.
    """
    print(request.values)
    # The logic goes here
    return
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```php title="index.php"
<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
use \SignalWire\LaML\VoiceResponse;

# This endpoint will be queried by SignalWire whenever an incoming call is received.
# We respond with an XML document which specifies the next instructions.

print_r($_REQUEST);
# The logic goes here
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript title="index.js"
import express from "express";
import { RestClient } from "@signalwire/compatibility-api";

const app = express();
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

/**
 * @param {express.Request} req
 * @param {express.Response} res
 */
function callHandler(req, res) {
  // This endpoint will be queried by SignalWire whenever an incoming call is received.
  // We respond with an XML document which specifies the next instructions.

  console.log(req.body);
  // The logic goes here.
}

app.get("/", callHandler);
app.post("/", callHandler);

app.listen(8080);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

In the next section we will configure a phone number to make an HTTP request to our call handler endpoint
when an incoming call is received.
The HTTP request will contain parameters including values such as the source number or the body of the incoming message.

For our simple phone service demo, our call handler needs to reference the current date and time,
as well as the phone number of the caller.
Our call handler will emit a modified cXML document based on those values, 
allowing our application to modify the call flow and content based on server logic.

<Tabs groupId="compatibility-api">

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python title="main.py"
from flask import Flask, request, Response
from twilio.twiml.voice_response import VoiceResponse
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def call_handler():
    """
    This endpoint will be queried by SignalWire whenever an incoming call is received.
    We respond with an XML document which specifies the next instructions.
    """
    print(request.values)

    # Get the caller's number
    caller = request.values.get('From')

    now = datetime.now()

    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say(f"Welcome! Today is {now.strftime('%A')}.")
    response.say(f"Your phone number ends in {caller[-2:]}.")
    if now.weekday() >= 5:
        response.say(f"Enjoy the weekend.")

    return Response(response.to_xml(), mimetype='text/xml')
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```php title="index.php"
<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
use \SignalWire\LaML\VoiceResponse;

$caller = $_REQUEST['From'] ?? '';

$response = new VoiceResponse;
$response->say("Welcome! Today is " . date('l'));
$response->say("Your phone number ends in " . substr($caller, -2));
if (date('w') == 0 || date('w') == 6) {
    $response->say("Enjoy the weekend.");
}

header('Content-type: text/xml');
echo $response->asXML();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript title="index.js"
import express from "express";
import { RestClient } from "@signalwire/compatibility-api";

const app = express();
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

/**
 * @param {express.Request} req
 * @param {express.Response} res
 */
function callHandler(req, res) {
  // This endpoint will be queried by SignalWire whenever an incoming call is received.
  // We respond with an XML document which specifies the next instructions.

  /** @type string */
  const caller = req.body?.["From"] ?? "";

  const now = new Date();

  const response = new RestClient.LaML.VoiceResponse();
  response.say("Welcome! Today is " + now.toLocaleString("en-us", { weekday: "long" }));
  response.say("Your phone number ends in " + caller.slice(-2));
  if (now.getDay() === 0 || now.getDay() === 6) {
    response.say("Enjoy the weekend.");
  }

  res.set("Content-Type", "text/xml");
  res.send(response.toString());
}

app.get("/", callHandler);
app.post("/", callHandler);

app.listen(8080);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This simple message handler works like a dynamic XML bin, whose content depends
on the received message.

Try running the application, which will listen on port 8080:

<Tabs groupId="compatibility-api">

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```bash
python3 -m flask --app main.py run --host='0.0.0.0' --port 8080
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 -v "$PWD":/var/www/html php:8.1-apache
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```bash
node index.js
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Since you are likely behind a NAT, to test this application on your local
machine you need a public IP address that SignalWire can reach. We suggest using
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/): refer to our [guide on ngrok](/platform/basics/guides/technical-troubleshooting/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok)
for more information.

In short, while the application is up and listening on port 8080, run ngrok from a new terminal like this:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

You'll get a public random URL (such as `https://983f-93-41-16-193.ngrok.io/`)
that you can use to access your local application.

### Configuring the number

Now that the code is ready and the HTTP endpoint is reachable from the web, we
need to configure our SignalWire number to access it.

First, we need to create a new cXML script resource that points to your ngrok URL.
To do so, go to the "Resources" section from your sidebar, and create a new Script Resource.
Select the Script type as cXML.

![Script resource selector with cXML highlighted.](@image/dashboard/resources/new-cxml-bin.png)

When configuring the cXML script, select the "External URL" option, and paste the ngrok URL.

![cXML script configuration with external URL](@image/dashboard/resources/external-cxml-bin.png)

import NewLegacy from '/docs/home/platform/dashboard/_ui-admonition.mdx'

<NewLegacy />

If you don't have a phone
number yet, make sure to [buy one](/platform/phone-numbers/getting-started/buying-a-phone-number). You
will need at least one number to receive messages.

You can do that from the "Phone Numbers" section in the Sidebar. Go to the Settings page of the number you
want to configure. In the `Handling Inbound Calls` section, select your 

![Assign Resource](@image/dashboard/phone-numbers/assign-resource-voice.png)

Refer to [Making and Receiving Phone Calls](../../../../../home/products/voice/getting-started/making-and-receiving-phone-calls/index.mdx#receiving-incoming-calls) for more information about this step.

<Accordion 
  title="If you're on the Legacy UI"
  defaultOpen={false}
>

You don't need to create a new cXML resource for your call.

Simply open the settings for the number you want to configure, and under "Voice and Fax Settings", 
choose to handle incoming calls using "LaML Webhooks", then paste the public ngrok URL
which connects to your application.

![legacy UI cxml webhook configuration](@image/dashboard/legacy/external-cxml-webhook.webp)

</Accordion>

Try dialing the configured phone number: after a few seconds you'll receive an
automated reply, whose content will be different depending on the day of the
week.

## Conclusion

We have shown how to handle calls from code, by emitting XML
documents whose content depends on external factors. We did all this in the
context of the [Compatibility API](/compatibility-api).

For more advanced, real-time applications, you'll want to check out
our [Realtime SDK](/sdks/reference/realtime-sdk/relay-v4). Find more details
