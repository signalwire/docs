## What is Click-to-Call?

SignalWire Click-to-Call (C2C) is an embeddable script that adds real-time voice communication functionality directly to your
website with minimal setup. With just a few lines of code, you can embed SignalWire's calling capabilities inside an HTML page,
allowing your website visitors to initiate voice calls directly from your web pages without requiring any additional software
or setup.


:::info Want to build more advanced applications?
Click-to-Call provides a simple way to embed voice communication on your website. If you need more advanced customization
or features, the C2C widget uses the 
[SignalWire Client SDK][browser-sdk]. 
You can leverage this SDK directly to build more sophisticated communication applications with additional control and functionality.

## Prerequisites

The C2C embedable script requires:

- A SignalWire account that has access to the [dashboard][dashboard]
- A website where you can embed the C2C widget

:::warning
For security reasons, some low-code/no-code site builders restrict the permission of embedded scripts. 
In these environments, C2C may not function properly.

## Setting up click-to-call

<Steps>

### Create your Click-to-Call widget

Start by creating a widget in your SignalWire Dashboard:

1. Log in to your [SignalWire Dashboard][dashboard]
2. Navigate to [Tools > Click To Call][dashboard-c2c]
3. Configure your widget settings:
   - Give your widget a descriptive **name**
   - Set a **destination** for incoming calls (this is the [resource address][resource-address] that will receive calls)
   - Adjust any other settings as needed
4. Click **Save** to generate your widget
5. Click the **Copy Embeddable Widget** button to copy your personalized C2C script

The copied script will look similar to this (but with your unique API key):

:::warning Do not use this example
This is just a sample for reference. Always use the script generated from your dashboard.
:::

```html
<script>
(a => {
  // Minified initialization code...
})({ apiKey: "c2c_YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY", v: "0.0.1" });

// Widget configuration
sw.c2c.spawn('C2CButton', {
  destination: '/private/example',
  buttonParentSelector: '#click2call',
  callParentSelector: '#call',
  // Additional parameters...
});
</script>
```

### Prepare your website

Before adding the script to your website, you need to add two HTML elements where the call button and interface will appear:

```html
<!-- Add these elements where you want the C2C components to appear -->
<div id="click2call"></div>  <!-- This will become your call button -->
<div id="call"></div>        <!-- This will display the call interface when active -->
```

These elements can be positioned anywhere in your HTML based on where you want the button and call interface to appear on your page.

:::tip Using existing elements
If you prefer to use existing elements on your page instead of creating new ones, you can modify the script to target those elements in the next step. Simply note the IDs of your existing elements and update the `buttonParentSelector` and `callParentSelector` parameters accordingly. See the [Technical Reference][technical-reference] for more details on these and other configurable selectors.
:::

### Add the C2C script to your website

With your container elements in place, you're ready to add the Click-to-Call script to your website:

1. **Open your website's HTML file** in your preferred editor

2. **Choose the best location for the script:**
   - **Head section** (recommended): Placing it in the `<head>` ensures the script loads early, making the button available as soon as possible
   - **End of body**: Alternatively, you can place it just before the closing `</body>` tag if you prefer to load scripts last

3. **Add the script** you copied from the dashboard to your chosen location:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Your Website Title</title>
  <!-- Your other head elements (stylesheets, meta tags, etc.) -->
  
  <!-- Option 1: Place script here in the head section -->
  <!-- <script></script> -->

</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your website content -->
  
  <!-- The container elements for the Click-to-Call components -->
  <div id="click2call"></div>
  <div id="call"></div>
  
  <!-- More of your website content -->
  
  <!-- Option 2: Or place script here at the end of the body -->
  <!-- <script></script> -->
</body>
</html>
```

The script will automatically find your container elements and render the call button and interface in those locations.

### Test your implementation

1. Save your changes and open your website in a browser
2. You should see the Click-to-Call button in the location you specified
3. Click the button to test:
   - A call interface should appear
   - A call should be initiated to your configured destination
4. Try making a test call to ensure everything works properly

If the button doesn't appear or calls don't connect, check:
- That your element IDs match what's in the script
- That the script is properly placed in your HTML
- Your browser console for any JavaScript errors
