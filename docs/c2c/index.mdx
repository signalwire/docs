# Click-to-Call

SignalWire Click-to-Call (C2C) allows you to embed real-time voice communication functionality directly into your website with minimal setup. It enables your website visitors to initiate voice calls directly from your web pages without requiring any additional software.

## What is Click-to-Call?

C2C is a specialized loading mechanism that embeds SignalWire's Personal User Client (PUC) call capabilities inside an HTML page. With just a few lines of code, you can add professional voice calling features that connect your website visitors with your team or services.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight Integration**: Minimal script footprint with no heavy dependencies
- **Customizable UI**: Fully adaptable button appearance and call widget positioning
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Rich lifecycle events for controlling call flow
- **Simple Setup**: Easy configuration through the SignalWire Dashboard
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms for graceful error management

## Prerequisites

C2C requires:

- A SignalWire account with access to the Prime Dashboard
- A website where you can modify HTML code
- A modern browser that supports:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - ECMAScript 2024 (ES15)

:::warning
For security reasons, some low-code/no-code site builders restrict the permission of embedded scripts. In these environments, C2C may not function properly.
:::

## Setting Up Click-to-Call

Follow these steps to add Click-to-Call capability to your website:

### Step 1: Create Your C2C Widget in Dashboard

1. Log in to your SignalWire Prime Dashboard
2. Navigate to `Tools > Click2Call`
3. Configure your call destinations and settings:
   - Select the phone numbers or SIP addresses that will receive the calls
   - Configure display options as needed
4. Generate and copy the C2C snippet

### Step 2: Prepare Your Website

Add container elements to your HTML where the button and call widget will be rendered:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>My Website with Click-to-Call</title>
  <!-- Your existing head content -->
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your website content -->

  <!-- Container for the C2C button -->
  <div id="click2call"></div>
  
  <!-- Container for the call widget -->
  <div id="call"></div>
  
  <!-- Your additional website content -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Add the C2C Snippet

Paste the snippet you copied from the dashboard into your HTML page. The snippet can be placed anywhere in the HTML, either in the head or body section:

```html
<script>
// Paste your C2C snippet here
(a => {
  var i, s, k, n = "Signalwire C2C API", o = "sw", c = "spawn", x = "Loaded", h = "authenticate", y = a["apiKey"],
    r = document, k = window;
  k = k[o] || (k[o] = {});
  var w = k.c2c || (k.c2c = {}), l = (p) => new Promise(async (u, v) => {
    await (s = r.createElement("script"));
    s.src = `${k.codeRepository}/${p}.js`;
    w[`${p}${x}`] = () => {
      delete w[`${p}${a}`];
      !w[h] ? w[c](h, y).then(u) : u();
    };
    s.onerror = () => i = v(Error(n + " could not load."));
    s.nonce = r.querySelector("script[nonce]")?.nonce || "";
    r.head.append(s);
  });
  k.relayHost = "puc.signalwire.com";
  k.codeRepository = "https://app.signalwire.com";
  k.authEndpoint = "https://example.signalwire.com/api/fabric/embeds/tokens";
  w[c] ? k[h](y) : w[c] = (f, ...n) => new Promise((g,) => {w[f] ? g(w[f](...n)) : l(f).then(() => g(w[f](...n)))})
})
({ apiKey: "c2c_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", v: "0.0.1" });

// Initialize the C2C component
sw.c2c.spawn('C2CButton', {
  destination: '/public/example',
  buttonParentSelector: '#click2call',
  callParentSelector: '#call',
  // Other parameters configured in your dashboard
});
</script>
```

### Step 4: Test Your Implementation

1. Load your web page in a browser
2. Verify that the C2C button appears in the expected location
3. Click the button to initiate a test call
4. Confirm that the call connects properly

:::tip
While most configuration is handled through the dashboard when creating your C2C snippet, you can customize the behavior and appearance by modifying the parameters passed to the `sw.c2c.spawn` method. See the [Technical Reference](./technical-reference.mdx) for details.
:::

## Understanding the C2C Snippet

The C2C snippet consists of two main parts:

1. **Async Loader IIFE**: An Immediately Invoked Function Expression that loads the necessary scripts and establishes the connection to SignalWire services.
   
2. **Component Initialization**: The `sw.c2c.spawn` method call that renders the button and configures the call behavior.

:::warning
The async loader portion of the snippet should not be modified. If you need to change connection details such as the API key, generate a new snippet from the dashboard.
